1. Add about our founder section after the FAQ. Use the attached resume to write the copy for the section following the format: "Alex and Leila Hormozi are co-founders and managing partners of Acquisition.com. In four years, the portfolio grew to over $250m+ in annual revenue. Before Acquisition.com they founded Gym Launch, Prestige Labs, and ALAN. In 2021, a private equity sponsor purchased Gym Launch and Prestige Labs for $46.2M. And in that same year, a strategic buyer bought ALAN in an all stock deal.

Alex wrote two best selling books $100M Offers and $100M Leads, both of which have sold over 1M copies and are still #1 & #2 on Amazon for Marketing & Sales.

Their mission at Acquisition.com is to make real business education accessible to everyone. And to do that, they strive to build a business that improves the lives of everyone it comes in contact with. They built a culture of praise over punishment to make it happen. Alex and Leila have an audience of over 12M+ that subscribe to their business content across social media."
