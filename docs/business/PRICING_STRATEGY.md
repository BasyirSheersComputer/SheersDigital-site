You've identified a critical part of scaling a SaaS: moving from a standardized product to a custom solution for enterprise clients. The best way to approach this is to clearly define what is "template" (scalable) and what is "non-template" (bespoke).

### Breakdown of the System

#### 1. Template Part (Core SaaS Product)

This is the foundation of your softwareâ€”the "off-the-shelf" solution that provides a baseline of value to all customers. This part is designed for scalability and minimal human intervention.

**Components:**
* **Base Analytics & Reporting:** Dashboards showing key metrics like sales per location, staff performance, and food waste percentages.
* **Inventory Management:** A standardized system for tracking stock levels, setting reorder points, and generating purchase orders.
* **Staff Management:** Tools for scheduling, time-tracking, and basic performance tracking.
* **Point-of-Sale (POS) Integrations:** Standard API connectors for popular POS systems used in Malaysia (e.g., OMO, i-Neighbour, StoreHub).
* **Standard Features:** Core functionalities that address common pain points across most F&B businesses, such as a customer feedback module, basic menu management, and a reporting suite.

**Pricing:** The pricing for the template part should be on a tiered, per-10-outlets subscription model. This is where you would apply the value-based pricing strategy discussed earlier (e.g., RM 5,000 per month for Professional plan covering up to 10 outlets, RM 10,000 per month for Enterprise plan covering up to 10 outlets). The price is predictable and directly tied to the number of outlet groups, with clear scaling for larger chains.

#### 2. Non-Template Part (Bespoke Professional Services)

This is the custom, high-touch portion of your offering. It is designed to solve the unique, complex challenges of large enterprise clients and is where you justify the premium price. This is not a scalable software feature but a service and a strategic partnership.

**Components:**
* **Custom Integrations:** Building bespoke API connections with a chain's existing legacy systems, complex accounting software, or their specific supply chain management platform.
* **Advanced Data Modeling & Predictive Analytics:** Developing custom algorithms to forecast demand for specific menu items, optimize staffing based on hyper-local trends, or predict the impact of a new menu item on overall profitability.
* **Dedicated Account & Onboarding Manager:** A full-time resource assigned to the client to ensure a smooth, end-to-end implementation and ongoing strategic support.
* **On-site Audits and Consultations:** Sending your team to their outlets to analyze operational workflows, identify inefficiencies, and then configure the software to solve those specific problems.
* **Custom Reporting:** Building highly specific reports and dashboards that aggregate data from multiple sources to meet the unique needs of their corporate C-suite.
* **Change Management & Training:** Providing in-person, tailored training programs for their staff and management across all locations.

### Pricing the Non-Template Portion Appropriately

This is where you shift from a SaaS subscription model to a **Professional Services** or **Consulting Fee** model. The pricing for this should be separate from the core subscription and should not be a flat fee. It must reflect the time, effort, and bespoke value delivered.

Here are a few models for pricing the non-template portion:

#### **Model 1: Project-Based Fee**

This is the most common model. You provide a fixed, one-time fee for a specific scope of work (e.g., "full system implementation and custom integration with their existing ERP system").

* **How to Price It:** Estimate the total number of human-hours required for the project (e.g., senior developer, data analyst, project manager, consultant). Multiply these hours by a high hourly rate.
* **Example Calculation:**
    * **Implementation & Integration Team (e.g., 2 engineers, 1 project manager):** 200 hours @ RM 400/hour = RM 80,000
    * **Data & Analytics Team (e.g., 1 data scientist):** 80 hours @ RM 500/hour = RM 40,000
    * **On-site Consultation & Training:** RM 20,000
    * **Total Project-Based Fee:** **RM 140,000 (one-time)**
* **Why it works:** It's transparent and aligns the cost directly with the project's scope. It also protects your team from scope creep.

#### **Model 2: Retainer-Based Fee**

This model is ideal for ongoing strategic support and advisory services beyond the initial implementation. The client pays a recurring monthly or quarterly fee for a set number of hours or a dedicated resource.

* **How to Price It:** Charge a premium for a dedicated expert's time. This is for the client who wants continuous, on-demand support.
* **Example Calculation:**
    * **Dedicated Strategic Partner/Account Manager:** RM 15,000 - RM 25,000 per month.
    * This fee could include a certain number of hours of engineering or data science support each month.
* **Why it works:** It creates a predictable revenue stream for you and ensures the client has a dedicated expert to help them continuously maximize the value of the platform.

#### **Model 3: Hybrid Value-Based Fee**

This is the most advanced model and should be used with caution for very large, high-value clients. You charge a small percentage of the value you help them unlock.

* **How to Price It:** This would be an addition to the subscription fee and the project-based fee. For example, "In addition to your monthly subscription, you pay a one-time fee of RM 150,000 for implementation, plus a small success fee of 1% of the total profit we help you unlock in the first year."
* **Why it works:** It creates a highly compelling ROI story. If you can prove you helped them gain RM 1 million, a 1% success fee of RM 10,000 is a no-brainer.

**In summary, your pricing for a large F&B chain should be a combination of two distinct parts:**

1.  **The Template Part:** A recurring **subscription fee** (e.g., RM 5,000/month for Professional plan per 10 outlets, RM 10,000/month for Enterprise plan per 10 outlets) that covers the use of your scalable, core software.
2.  **The Non-Template Part:** A **one-time project-based fee** (e.g., RM 100,000-RM 200,000+) for implementation, custom integrations, and specialized consulting.

By separating these two, you provide a clear, understandable pricing structure that demonstrates the immense value of your bespoke services while maintaining the predictable revenue stream of a SaaS business.
