Option 1: The Direct and Confident Approach (Updated)
This version is streamlined and gets right to the point while still building a value-based argument.

1. The Opener (15 seconds)
"Hi [Prospect's Name], this is [Your Name] from Servora. We help F&B businesses like yours achieve complete operational transformation with our management platform. I'm calling because I saw your recent announcement about [Mention a specific post, award, or achievement]. Congratulationsâ€”it's impressive."

2. The Bridge (10-15 seconds)
"With that kind of success, it seems like you're focused on accelerating your growth and improving profitability. Is that accurate?"

3. The Value Proposition (30 seconds)
"We specialize in helping companies like yours leverage our platform for waste-logging automation and inventory integration. Our clients see an average monthly savings of RM 20,000+ by eliminating preventable food waste, and recover 15-20% of their profit margins within 30 days of implementation."

4. The Business Case and The "Offer" (20-30 seconds)
"Hypothetically, if we could help you save an additional RM 240,000+ per year, would it be worth investing a small fraction of that to make it happen?"

5. The Big Guarantee (15 seconds)
"To be completely transparent, we stand behind our work. Our promise is that we will help you start seeing results in just 5 days and we offer a 30-day money-back guarantee if you're not satisfied."

6. The Call to Action (10 seconds)
"This isn't a commitment to a full deal, but a way to get started. Our Professional Plan is RM 5,000 per month for 10 outlets, which translates to a yearly investment of RM 60,000 for your business. If we move forward today, all we need is an initial commitment deposit. Is that something you'd be open to?"

Option 2: The Empathy and Problem-Solving Approach (Updated)
This version is less rigid and focuses more on a consultative, problem-solving tone.

1. The Opener & Permission (15 seconds)
"Hi [Prospect's Name], my name is [Your Name] from Servora. I know you're busy, but I noticed the recent [Award/Achievement] for [Company Name]. I'd love to take 30 seconds to explain why I'm calling. Would that be okay?"

2. The Problem Statement (15-20 seconds)
"Based on your company's growth, you're likely focused on streamlining operations and boosting profitability. A common issue we see is that F&B businesses are losing a significant amount of money to preventable food waste, averaging RM 20,000+ per month. Is that a challenge you're currently facing or thinking about?"

3. The "Hypothetical Value" Frame (20 seconds)
"If we could help you recover 15-20% of your profit margins by implementing our waste-logging automation and inventory integration, what would that enable you to do as a company?"

4. The Price as a "Small Fraction" (15 seconds)
"Our Full Platform is designed for complete operational transformation. We've found that our most successful clients are willing to invest a small percentage of that future gain to make it a reality. For a larger operation, our Enterprise Plan is RM 10,000 per month for 10 outlets, which comes to a RM 120,000 yearly investment. This includes dedicated account management, 24/7 technical support, and staff training."

5. The Low-Risk Guarantee (15 seconds)
"We don't take risks with our clients' businesses. We'll help you start seeing results in as little as 5 days, and we offer a 30-day money-back guarantee."

6. The Closing (15-20 seconds)
"A lot of our clients get on board by simply committing to a small upfront deposit. This shows us you're serious about your growth goals, and it allows us to immediately allocate resources and start the process. Does that sound like a reasonable way to get the ball rolling?"
