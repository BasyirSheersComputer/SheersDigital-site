## Communication Templates

### Value Proposition (Hero Message)
```
Headline: Reduce Food Waste by 30-40% in 60 Days
Subheadline: Stop losing RM 15,000-25,000 monthly to preventable waste. Our proven system helps F&B businesses increase profit margins by 10-15% through smart inventory management and waste reduction.

Key Metrics:
- 30-40% waste reduced
- 60 days to results
- 50+ active clients
```

### Pain Point Messaging
```
Problem 1: Unpredictable Waste
"Losing RM 15,000-25,000 monthly per outlet to food waste you can't track or predict"

Problem 2: Manual Processes
"Wasting 20-30 hours weekly on manual tracking, paperwork, and compliance documentation"

Problem 3: Compliance Stress
"Living in fear of RM 50,000-250,000 fines from missing one compliance requirement"
```

### Urgency Messaging
```
"Every month you wait costs you RM 15,000-25,000 in preventable waste."

"While you're reading this, competitors are reducing waste by 40% and increasing margins by 15%."

"The cost of doing nothing: RM 20,000-50,000 lost monthly. The investment: RM 3,000-6,000 monthly with 5-10x ROI."
```

### Objection Handling

**Objection: "Too expensive"**
Response: "Let's look at the math. You're currently losing RM 20,000-50,000 monthly in waste. Our system costs RM 3,000-6,000 monthly and saves you 5-10x that amount. The question isn't 'can you afford it?' - it's 'can you afford NOT to fix this bleeding?'"

**Objection: "We're too small"**
Response: "That's exactly why this works so well for you. Small operations see faster results because changes happen quickly. Our Quick Win Solution is designed specifically for 1-5 outlets. Start small, scale when you're ready."

**Objection: "We'll do it later"**
Response: "I understand. Just know that every month of delay costs you RM 15,000-25,000 in preventable waste. That's RM 180,000-300,000 per year. Even if you start next quarter, that's RM 45,000-75,000 you'll never recover."

**Objection: "Not sure it will work for us"**
Response: "That's why we have the 30-day money-back guarantee. You don't have to be sure - just willing to test it. If you don't see measurable results in 30 days, full refund. Zero risk on your side."

**Objection: "Need to think about it"**
Response: "Absolutely, take time to think. While you do, can I send you the free waste audit? It shows exactly where you're losing money right now, no commitment required. Then you can make an informed decision."

## Visual Content Guidelines

### Image Selection
**Use**:

- Professional kitchen/restaurant settings
- Data visualizations showing results

**Avoid**:
- Generic stock photos of smiling people
- Fake product screenshots

### Data Visualization
```
Good Chart Example:

X-axis: Days (0, 30, 60, 90)
Y-axis: Waste Percentage (0-100%)
Data: Start 100%, Day 30: 85%, Day 60: 70%, Day 90: 60%
Source: "WasteWise Client Average (n=50)"

Bad Chart Example:
Vague title: "Results Over Time"
No axes labels
No source
Unrealistic curve
