### The Pain Section (Agitate)

**Headline:**
```
The Operational Knowledge Retrieval Bottleneck Is Bleeding Your Revenue
```

**Subheadline:**
```
While your agents search through PDFs, WhatsApp groups, and outdated spreadsheets, you're losing:
```

**Pain Points Grid:**

**1. Lost Bookings from Overflow**
- **The Problem:** 15–25% of calls go unanswered because agents take 6–9 minutes per call
- **The Cost:** RM 3.65M annually in lost booking opportunities
- **The Reality:** Every unanswered call is a guest who called your competitor instead

**2. Lost Revenue from Wrong Answers**
- **The Problem:** 2–5% of bookings are lost due to misinformation (wrong rates, availability, facilities)
- **The Cost:** RM 1.2M–1.8M annually in recovered revenue
- **The Reality:** Guests book elsewhere when they can't trust your agents' answers

**3. Lost Upsell Revenue**
- **The Problem:** Agents skip upselling when they don't know details (spa hours, upgrade pricing, activities)
- **The Cost:** RM 300K–450K annually in missed upsell opportunities
- **The Reality:** 8–12% improvement possible—but only if agents have instant answers

**4. Lost Repeat Business**
- **The Problem:** Slow issue resolution reduces guest satisfaction and repeat bookings
- **The Cost:** RM 300K–1.35M annually in lifetime value
- **The Reality:** 0.5–1.5% of guest revenue lost from poor experiences

**5. Training Cost Leakage**
- **The Problem:** 6-week training cycles for agents who leave in 6 months (86% industry turnover)
- **The Cost:** RM 100K–300K annually in wasted training
- **The Reality:** You're training agents to search for information instead of serving guests

---

### The Agitation Section

**Headline:**
```
Every Day You Wait, You're Losing RM 15,000–25,000
```

**Body:**
```
Based on conservative calculations for a resort with RM 60M–90M annual revenue:

- RM 3.65M lost from unanswered calls (20 extra calls/day × 10% conversion × RM 5,000/booking)
- RM 1.2M–1.8M lost from misinformation (2% recovery on RM 60M–90M)
- RM 300K–450K lost from missed upsells (10% improvement on 5–8% upsell revenue)
- RM 300K–1.35M lost from reduced repeat business (0.5–1.5% of guest revenue)
- RM 100K–300K lost from training inefficiency

**Total Annual Loss: RM 5.5M–9.0M**

This isn't a future problem. This is happening right now, every day, on every call.
