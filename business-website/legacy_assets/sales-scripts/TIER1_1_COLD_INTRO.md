## 🎤 PHONE COLD CALL (If you get them live)

### Opening (First 15 seconds):

```
[Phone rings, they answer]

YOU: "Hi, is this [Owner Name]?"

THEM: "Yes, who's this?"

YOU: "Hi [Owner], this is Basyir from WasteWise. I help restaurants like [Restaurant Name] reduce food waste and boost profit margins. 

Is now a bad time, or do you have 2 minutes for a quick question?"

[If bad time]: "No problem! When's a better time to call back - tomorrow morning or afternoon?"

[If they say okay]: Continue below...
```

---

### Hook Question (Next 30 seconds):

```
YOU: "Great! Quick question: Are you currently tracking food waste at [Restaurant Name]?"

THEM: [Various responses - see below for handling]

[If "No" or "Not really"]

YOU: "That's very common. Most restaurants don't track it because it seems complicated. 

Here's what we've found: single-location restaurants typically lose RM 15,000-25,000 monthly to preventable waste - spoilage, overproduction, theft.

Would it be worth 10 minutes next week to show you how to track that and cut it by 20-30%? No cost for the call, zero obligation."

[If "Yes, we track it"]

YOU: "That's great! Are you hitting your waste reduction targets, or is there room for improvement?"

[If hitting targets]: "Impressive! What system are you using? I'd love to learn from what's working."

[If room for improvement]: "That's where we help. Would 10 minutes next week be worth it to see if we can help you improve on what you're already doing?"
```

---

### Call-to-Action (Final 15 seconds):

```
YOU: "How about [Day] at [Time - 10am or 2pm]? Just 10 minutes on a quick call.

I'll show you:
1. Where restaurants your size typically lose the most money to waste
2. The 3 things you can do in the next 60 days to cut that by 20-30%
3. If our system is even right for you

No pressure, no hard sell. Just 10 minutes of value.

Does [Day/Time] work for you?"

[Get commitment, send calendar invite]

"Perfect! I'll send you a WhatsApp with the call link. Looking forward to helping [Restaurant Name] boost those margins. Have a great day!"
```

---

## 🚫 HANDLING IMMEDIATE OBJECTIONS

### "We're too busy right now"

**Response**:
```
"I totally understand - restaurant operations are non-stop!

That's exactly why I'm suggesting just 10 minutes. The busier you are, the less time you have to plug profit leaks.

10 minutes next week could save you RM 15-25k every month going forward.

How about next [slower day - Monday/Tuesday] at [time]? Just 10 minutes?"
```

---

### "Send me information first"

**Response**:
```
"I can definitely send you info, but honestly, it's easier to explain in 10 minutes than email. Every restaurant is different.

How about this: Let's jump on a quick call, I'll understand your specific situation, and then send you customized information that's actually relevant to [Restaurant Name].

[Day] at [Time]? Just 10 minutes?"
```

**If they insist**:
```
"No problem. I'll send you a quick overview.

But here's the thing: every month you wait costs you RM 15-25k in preventable waste. 

I'll include my calendar link in the email. When you're ready to stop the bleeding, book a call. Sound fair?"

[Send follow-up email with overview + Calendly link]
```

---

### "How much does it cost?"

**Response**:
```
"Great question! Our Quick Win package is RM 2,997 per month.

But here's what matters more: we guarantee you'll save RM 15-25k monthly, or you get your money back after 30 days. So it's risk-free.

The better question is: what's it costing you NOT to track and reduce waste?

10-minute call to see if the ROI makes sense for [Restaurant Name]?"
```

---

### "We don't have a waste problem"

**Response**:
```
"That's great if true! Though in my experience, every restaurant has some waste - it's the nature of fresh food.

Quick question: Do you know your exact food cost percentage and where your waste is coming from?

[If yes]: "Impressive! Most don't. What's your food cost % right now?"
[If <30%]: "That's excellent! You're ahead of most. Mind sharing what you're doing right?"
[If >35%]: "There's usually still room for improvement. 10 minutes to see if we can help you get that even lower?"

[If no]: "Then there might be hidden waste you're not seeing. That's RM 15-25k monthly on average. Worth 10 minutes to check?"
```

---

### "I need to think about it"

**Response**:
```
"Absolutely! I'm not asking you to decide anything today.

All I'm suggesting is 10 minutes to:
1. See if you even have a waste problem
2. Understand what's possible
3. Decide if it's worth exploring further

Nothing to think about yet - we haven't even talked!

[Day] at [Time]? Just 10 minutes, then you'll have real information to think about."
```

---

### "Not interested"

**Response**:
```
"No worries at all! Can I ask - is waste reduction not a priority right now, or are you handling it well already?

[If not a priority]: "I understand. Just so you know: every month costs you RM 15-25k in preventable waste. When timing's better, I'm here."

[If handling well]: "That's great! Would you mind sharing what's working? I'm always learning from successful operators."

Thanks for your time, and best of luck with [Restaurant Name]!"

[Mark as "Not Now" in CRM, follow up in 3-6 months]

**Your Response**:
```
"Perfect! I can give you the 2-minute overview now, then if it makes sense, we can schedule 10 minutes to go deeper.

Sound good?"

```

---

### 2-Minute Elevator Pitch:

```
"So here's the situation: Most single-location restaurants lose RM 15-25k monthly to food waste - spoilage, overproduction, theft, portion inconsistency.

The problem is, without tracking it, you don't know where it's going or how to fix it.

Our Quick Win system helps you:
1. Track waste automatically (takes staff 30 seconds per day)
2. See exactly where money is bleeding
3. Reduce waste by 20-30% within 60 days

It's RM 2,997 per month, but we guarantee you'll save RM 15-25k or we refund you after 30 days. So it's completely risk-free.

The 10-minute call is just to understand your specific situation and see if we're a good fit.

Does this sound relevant to [Restaurant Name], or am I off base?"

[Listen to response]

"Great! Let's book that 10 minutes. Tuesday at 10am or Wednesday at 2pm?"
```

## 🔄 FOLLOW-UP SEQUENCE (If No Response)

### Follow-Up #1 (24 hours after initial message):

```
Hi [Owner Name],

Not sure if you saw my message yesterday about reducing food waste at [Restaurant Name]?

Just wanted to follow up - most restaurant owners don't realize they're losing RM 15-25k monthly to preventable waste.

If you're interested in a quick (10-minute) chat to see if we can help, let me know!

If not, no worries - just let me know and I'll stop bothering you 😊

```

---

### Follow-Up #2 (3 days after initial, if still no response):

```
Hi [Owner Name],

Last message, I promise! 😊

Did some quick math: If [Restaurant Name] is doing RM [estimated revenue]/month with typical 35-40% food costs, you're likely losing RM 15-20k monthly to waste.

That's RM 180-240k per year.

We can help you cut that by 20-30% with a simple tracking system.

Worth 10 minutes to explore?

If not interested, just reply "Not now" and I'll check back in 6 months instead.

Basyir
+60 11-6326 3808
```

---

### Follow-Up #3 (7 days after initial, FINAL):

```
Hi [Owner Name],

I'll stop following up after this! 😊

Just wanted to share something that might be relevant:

We recently helped a similar [type] restaurant in [nearby area] reduce waste by 28% in 45 days. They're now saving RM 18k monthly.

The owner said: "I wish I'd started tracking this years ago."

If you'd like to see if similar results are possible for [Restaurant Name], I'm happy to spend 10 minutes showing you how.

If not, no worries! Best of luck with the business.

Basyir
+60 11-6326 3808

P.S. If timing's just not right now, when should I check back - 3 months or 6 months?

## 💬 SAMPLE CONVERSATION FLOW

### Scenario: Owner Responds Positively

```
THEM: "Yes, we're interested. What is this about?"

YOU: "Great! Quick overview: We help restaurants track and reduce food waste.

Instead of explaining over text, easier if we jump on a quick 10-minute call where I can understand your specific situation.

Tuesday at 10am or Wednesday at 2pm?"

THEM: "Tuesday works. But how much is this?"

YOU: "Perfect! It's RM 2,997/month, but we guarantee you save RM 15-25k or you get refunded after 30 days. So it's risk-free.

Let's discuss on Tuesday - I'll send you a calendar invite. Looking forward to it!"

2. Industry data shows restaurants using waste tracking achieve 25-40% reduction (World Resources Institute, 2023). This isn't magic - it's proven.

Worth 10 minutes to see if it's right for your restaurant? No commitment, just exploring."

THEM: "Okay, fine. When?"

YOU: "Tuesday 10am or Wednesday 2pm?"
```
