# Tier 3 (Enterprise) - Cold Intro Script  
## Goal: Set 30-Minute Executive Briefing

**Target ICP**: Large chains (10+ outlets), RM 1M+/mo revenue  
**Decision Makers**: C-Suite (CEO, COO, CFO) + Board approval often required  
**Channel**: Email (Primary), LinkedIn (Secondary), Executive Assistant coordination  
**Research Required**: 30-60 minutes per prospect

---

## 🎯 ENTERPRISE OUTREACH STRATEGY

**Key Differences from Tier 1/2**:
- **Formal process** (not casual WhatsApp)
- **Multiple gatekeepers** (EAs, procurement)
- **Long sales cycle** (2-6 months)
- **Committee decisions** (not individual)
- **RFP process** (often required)
- **Vendor vetting** (security, compliance, stability)

**Success Metrics**:
- **5-15% response rate** (vs 25-35% Tier 1)
- **2-6 month sales cycle** (vs 2-4 weeks Tier 1)
- **Custom pricing** (RM 15k-50k+/month)
- **Higher close value** (RM 180k-600k+ annually)

---

## 📋 PRE-OUTREACH RESEARCH (30-60 Minutes)

### Essential Research:

✅ **Company Structure**
- Exact # of outlets (check all sources)
- Corporate structure (Sdn Bhd, Public, Holdings)
- Ownership (founder-led, PE-backed, public)
- Org chart (who reports to whom)

✅ **Financial Intelligence**
- Public filings (if Bursa-listed)
- Revenue estimates (outlets × avg)
- Recent funding/investment news
- Profitability indicators

✅ **Strategic Initiatives**
- Expansion plans (news, job postings)
- New concepts/brands launching
- Franchise programs
- Regional expansion (ASEAN)

✅ **Technology Landscape**
- Current ERP system
- POS systems across outlets
- Digital maturity
- IT team size/capability

✅ **Decision Makers**
- CEO/Founder (visionary, strategic)
- COO (operations, implementation)
- CFO (budget, ROI)
- CIO/CTO (if exists - technical validation)

✅ **Key Stakeholder Mapping**
- Who's the champion likely to be?
- Who's the blocker (often CFO or operations resistant to change)?
- Who has final authority?

### Email Template (Formal, Executive-Appropriate):

```
Subject: [Company Name] - Enterprise waste reduction across [X] locations

Dear [Mr./Ms. Last Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

I'm reaching out because [Company Name]'s growth to [X] outlets across [regions] is impressive, and I believe we can help you scale even more efficiently.

**THE ENTERPRISE CHALLENGE**:

At your scale, even small operational inefficiencies compound across all locations.

Most enterprises with 10+ outlets face:
• Fragmented systems (each location uses different tools)
• Limited enterprise-wide visibility
• Difficulty standardizing operations at scale
• Waste percentages that vary 5-10% between best and worst outlets

That 5-10% variance across [X] outlets = RM 100-300k+ monthly.

**HOW WE HELP ENTERPRISE F&B OPERATIONS**:

WasteWise Enterprise Platform provides:

✓ **Full ERP Integration** (SAP, Oracle, or your existing systems)
✓ **Enterprise Dashboard** (board-level visibility)
✓ **Franchise-Ready Operations** (standardized, replicable)
✓ **Dedicated Account Team** (strategic partnership, not just support)

**Results**: 40-50% waste reduction, RM 100-300k+ monthly savings, 8% margin increase

**Recent Example**: [Public Company Name if available, or "15-outlet hotel chain in KL"] achieved 44% reduction across all locations, saving RM 180k monthly.

**WORTH AN EXPLORATORY CONVERSATION?**

Given [Company]'s scale and sophistication, I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how we can support your continued growth.

I'm happy to work through your preferred process:
• Direct 30-minute executive briefing (just you and I)
• Presentation to your operations committee
• RFP/RFI submission (if that's your procurement process)
• Whatever works best for [Company]

Would you or your COO have 30 minutes for an initial conversation?

If you prefer, I can coordinate through your EA or directly with your Operations Director.

Best regards,

## 💼 ALTERNATIVE ENTRY POINTS

### Path 1: Start with COO/Operations Director

**Often Easier Than CEO**:
```
Dear [COO Name],

As [Company]'s Chief Operating Officer overseeing [X] outlets, you're likely focused on operational excellence and scaling efficiency.

Quick question: How do you currently ensure operational consistency and performance visibility across all locations?

We specialize in helping enterprise F&B operations (10+ outlets) achieve:
• Centralized visibility across all locations
• Standardized operations at scale
• 40-50% waste reduction chain-wide

Worth a 30-minute discussion about [Company]'s operational strategy?

Best regards,
Basyir Abdul Rahman

### Path 2: Start with Finance/CFO

**If ROI is key driver**:
```
Dear [CFO Name],

Quick financial opportunity to bring to your attention:

Multi-location F&B enterprises typically lose 8-15% of food cost to waste.

At [Company]'s scale ([X] outlets, ~RM [Y] food spend monthly), that's RM 100-300k monthly.

We help enterprise chains reduce that by 40-50%, improving EBITDA margins by 8-10%.

Worth 30 minutes to review the financial case for [Company]?

Best regards,
Basyir Abdul Rahman

## 🎯 ENTERPRISE-SPECIFIC HOOKS

### Hook 1: Franchise Preparation

```
[Company]'s franchise program launch is exciting!

Before most chains franchise successfully, they need bullet-proof operational systems that franchisees can replicate.

We help enterprise chains build franchise-ready waste management and compliance systems.

We help public F&B companies achieve this through enterprise waste reduction.

Worth a conversation with your CFO?
```

---

### Hook 3: Regional Expansion

```
Saw [Company] is expanding into [new region/country].

As you enter new markets, operational consistency becomes critical.

We help enterprise chains standardize operations across regions/countries through centralized waste and inventory management.
