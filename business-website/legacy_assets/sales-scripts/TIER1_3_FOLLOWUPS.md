## 📱 FOLLOW-UP #2: 24 HOURS AFTER CALL

### WhatsApp Check-In:

```
Hi [Owner]!

Hope you're doing well!

Just checking - did you get the proposal I sent yesterday?

Any questions so far, or anything unclear?

Still on for our Friday 2pm call to finalize details!

Basyir
```

**Keep It Light**:
- Not pushy
- Just confirming receipt
- Reminding of scheduled follow-up
- Opening door for questions

**If They Respond with Questions**:
- Answer thoroughly
- Always tie back to ROI (RM 12-22k net benefit)
- End with: "Does that help? Still good for Friday?"

---

## 📞 FOLLOW-UP #3: 3 DAYS AFTER CALL (Scheduled Call)

### Opening:

```
YOU: "Hi [Owner]! It's Basyir calling as scheduled. Still got 10 minutes?"

THEM: "Yes"

YOU: "Great! So you've had a few days to think about the Waste Logging system and the RM 15-25k savings opportunity.

What questions have come up?"

[LISTEN. They'll tell you what's holding them back]
```

---

### If They Have Questions:

**Answer each thoroughly, then**:
```
YOU: "Does that answer your concern?"

[If yes to all]:

YOU: "Excellent! So now that those are addressed, shall we move forward? 

I can have the team start your setup as early as next week, and you'd be live within 30 days.

Sound good?"

[Push for close]
```

---

### If They're Still Hesitating:

```
YOU: "I'm sensing some hesitation. Can I ask - what's really holding you back?

Is it:
- The investment amount?
- Doubt it'll work?
- Bad timing?
- Something else?

Be honest with me - I'd rather know so I can either address it or let you off the hook!"

[Listen to real objection]

[Address it specifically, see objection handling section]

[Then]:

YOU: "Okay, so if [objection] is resolved, you're ready to move forward?"

THEM: [Should be yes]

YOU: [Resolve objection]

YOU: "So that's resolved. Can we get you started?"
```

---

### If They Need More Time:

```
YOU: "I understand you need more time. Let me ask this:

What specifically do you need to happen or know before you can make a decision?

[Listen - could be]:
- "Talk to partner"
- "Review budget"
- "Check with accountant"
- "See one more option"

YOU: "Okay, so you need to [their thing]. When will that happen?"

THEM: "By next week"

YOU: "Perfect! So if [their thing] goes well, you'd be ready to proceed next week?"

THEM: "Yes"

YOU: "Great! I'll check in with you next Tuesday. And just to be clear - if we get the green light then, how quickly can you move?

Asking because we have limited implementation slots and I want to make sure we can get you in."

[Creates mild scarcity without being pushy]
```

---

## 📱 FOLLOW-UP #4: 7 DAYS AFTER CALL (Urgency)

### WhatsApp Message:

```
Hi [Owner],

Been a week since our call about reducing waste at [Restaurant Name].

Quick question: Did you get a chance to review the proposal and discuss with [partner/team]?

I ask because we have just a few implementation slots left this month, and I'd hate for you to miss out and have to wait another month.

Every month delayed = another RM 15-25k lost to preventable waste.

Can we finalize this week so you're saving money by end of the month?

Let me know - happy to jump on a quick call if you have any last questions!

Basyir
+60 11-6326 3808
```

**What This Does**:
- Creates urgency (limited slots)
- Reminds of cost of inaction (RM 15-25k monthly)
- Makes it easy (offers to answer questions)
- Direct ask (finalize this week)

---

### If They Respond Positively:

```
THEM: "Yes, let's do it"

YOU: "Excellent decision! You're going to see great results.

I'll send over the agreement now - takes 2 minutes to sign digitally.

Once I get that back, I'll have the team reach out tomorrow to schedule your onboarding.

You'll be live and tracking waste within 30 days, guaranteed!

Sending agreement now..."

[Send agreement immediately, guide them through signing]
```

---

### If They're Still On the Fence:

```
THEM: "Still thinking about it"

YOU: "I understand! But can I be direct with you?

You've been thinking about this for a week now. Meanwhile, [Restaurant Name] has lost another RM 15-25k to waste.

We have a 30-day money-back guarantee. There's literally zero risk.

So what's really stopping you - is it doubt it'll work, the investment, timing, or something else?

Let's address that head-on so you can make a decision one way or the other.

What's the real concern?"

[Listen, address, close]
```

---

## 📱 FOLLOW-UP #5: 14 DAYS AFTER CALL (FINAL - Take Away Sale)

### The "Break-Up" Message:

```
Hi [Owner],

It's been 2 weeks since our call about reducing waste at [Restaurant Name].

I haven't heard back, so I'm assuming one of these:
1. Not the right time
2. Not interested
3. Went with someone else
4. Too busy to respond

All totally fine!

I'll close your file and stop following up.

If I'm wrong and you DO want to move forward, just let me know by Friday.

Otherwise, I'll check back in 6 months to see if timing's better then.

Best of luck with [Restaurant Name]! 

Basyir
```

**Why This Works**:
- Respectful (not pushy)
- Creates urgency (deadline)
- Take-away psychology (people don't like losing options)
- Clean close (either way, you get clarity)

---

### Common Responses to "Break-Up":

**Response 1: "Sorry, been busy! Yes, let's proceed"**
```
YOU: "No worries at all! Restaurants are hectic.

Great news: We still have slots available.

Can you sign the agreement today so we can get you scheduled? I'll send it now."

[Close the deal]
```

---

**Response 2: "Can I have one more week?"**
```
YOU: "I can give you until Friday, but that's it - we need to allocate implementation resources.

Friday 5pm deadline - either we start, or I have to move on to other clients.

Fair enough?"

[If they agree]:
"Perfect! Friday by 5pm - yes or no. I'll follow up Friday morning to see where you're at.

Sound good?"
```

---

**Response 3: "Not interested" / No Response**
```
[If they say not interested]:
YOU: "Thanks for letting me know! I appreciate the honesty.

Can I ask - was it the investment, timing, or something else? (Just for my learning)"

[Note their response]

YOU: "Got it. I'll check back in 6 months to see if things change. Best of luck!"

[Mark as "Lost" in CRM, set 6-month reminder]
```

```
[If no response at all]:
[Mark as "Lost - No Response" in CRM]
[Set 6-month reminder to try again]
[Move on to next prospects]
```

---

## 🔥 ADVANCED FOLLOW-UP TACTICS

### Tactic 1: The "Customer Win" Share

**When to Use**: After Follow-Up #2 or #3

```
Hey [Owner]!

Quick update while you're reviewing the proposal:

Just got off a call with [Restaurant Name 2] - similar size to yours in [City].

They went live 45 days ago with our Waste Logging system.

Results so far:
• Waste reduced: 28%
• Monthly savings: RM 19,200
• ROI: 5.4x (saving RM 16,200 net after our fee)

Owner's quote: "I wish I'd done this 2 years ago. Would have saved RM 400k+"

Sound like what you want at [Restaurant Name]?

Let's get you similar results! Ready to proceed?

Basyir
```

**Why This Works**:
- Social proof (similar restaurant)
- Specific results (real numbers)
- FOMO (they want those results too)
- Direct ask

---

### Tactic 2: The "Limited Slot" Push

**When to Use**: After Follow-Up #3 (1 week later)

```
[Owner],

Update on implementation slots:

We have just 2 slots left for Month [X] onboarding.

After that, next available is Month [X+1] - meaning you'd start saving 30 days later.

30 days = another RM 15-25k lost to waste while you wait.

I've held a slot for [Restaurant Name] until Friday.

After Friday, I have to release it to the waitlist.

Ready to lock it in?

Just reply "YES" and I'll send the agreement to sign today.

Basyir
```

**Use Sparingly**: Only if true (don't fabricate scarcity)

---

### Tactic 3: The "Cost of Inaction" Calculator

**When to Use**: If they're dragging feet past 7 days

```
[Owner],

Quick math for you:

Days since our call: 7
Days until decision: 7 more (you said next week)
Total delay: 14 days

Cost of that delay:
• 14 days of waste: RM 7-12k lost
• 14 days of not tracking: Can't identify patterns
• 14 days of savings missed: RM 7-12k

**Total cost of "thinking about it": RM 14-24k**

Meanwhile, our guarantee means you risk NOTHING.

Why not start now, see results in 30 days, and if you're not happy, get refunded?

You literally cannot lose. But you CAN keep losing RM 15-25k every month.

Let's stop the bleeding. Ready to proceed?

Basyir
```

---

### Tactic 4: The "Objection Reversal"

**When to Use**: If they've raised specific objections

```
Hi [Owner],

Been thinking about your concern: "[their objection]"

You're right to be careful. Here's what I'd do in your shoes:

[Provide solution to their concern]

But here's the thing: Even with that concern, the 30-day guarantee removes all risk.

Worst case: You try it for 30 days, decide it's not right, get fully refunded.

Best case: You save RM 15-25k monthly for the rest of your business life.

Risk: RM 0 (guaranteed refund)
Reward: RM 180-300k annually

That's asymmetric opportunity - massive upside, zero downside.

What's stopping you from taking the guaranteed win?

Basyir
```

---

## 🎯 SPECIFIC FOLLOW-UP SCENARIOS

### Scenario A: "Waiting for Partner to Decide"

**Follow-Up Message** (3 days after call):
```
Hi [Owner],

Any update from your discussion with [partner]?

If it would help, I'm happy to jump on a quick call with both of you to answer any questions they might have.

Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon work for a 10-minute three-way call?

Or if they prefer, I can send them additional info directly.

What works best?

Basyir
```

**If They Say**: "They're okay with it, just need to finalize"
```
YOU: "Fantastic! So we're good to proceed?

I'll send the agreement now - once both of you sign, we'll schedule your onboarding this week.

Sound good?"

[Send agreement, get signature, CLOSE]
```

---

### Scenario B: "Checking Budget / Cash Flow"

**Follow-Up Message** (5 days after call):
```
Hi [Owner],

Following up on the budget review for WasteWise.

Thought this might help:

**Budget Perspective**:
• Cost: RM 2,997/month
• Savings: RM 15-25k/month
• **Net Cash Flow Improvement: +RM 12-22k monthly**

So this actually IMPROVES your cash flow, not hurts it.

Plus, first month we guarantee RM 15k savings or refund - so you're cash-flow positive from month 1.

Does that change the calculation?

If budget's truly tight, we can discuss:
• Starting Month 2 (after next month's revenue)
• Monthly vs annual payment options

Let me know what works for [Restaurant Name]!

Basyir
```

---

### Scenario C: "Want to See Demo First"

**Follow-Up Message** (next day):
```
Hi [Owner],

Following up on the demo request:

I can show you the system this week - 15 minute screen-share over WhatsApp video.

Available:
• Wednesday 2pm
• Thursday 10am  
• Friday 11am

Which works for you?

After the demo, if you like what you see, we can finalize and get you started!

Basyir
```

**During Demo Call**:
- Show waste logging interface (mobile app)
- Show reporting dashboard
- Show how easy it is (30 seconds to log waste)
- Show sample reports
- Answer questions
- **Then close**: "So now that you've seen it, ready to get started?"

---

## 🚫 HANDLING DELAY TACTICS

### They Say: "Can you call me back next week?"

**Response**:
```
YOU: "I can, but let me ask - what's going to be different next week?

Because if you're waiting for perfect timing, there's never a perfect time in restaurants. You're always busy.

The question is: Is saving RM 15-25k monthly worth starting now, even if timing isn't perfect?

If yes, let's get started.

If no, that's okay - but I need to know so I can plan accordingly.

What do you think?"
```

**Push for Decision**: Yes, No, or Specific Condition (not vague "maybe later")

---

### They Say: "Need to research other options"

**Response**:
```
YOU: "Totally fair! Due diligence is smart.

Can I ask - what are you comparing us against? Happy to do a side-by-side if helpful.

[Listen]

YOU: "Great! Here's what I'd suggest:

Take this week to research. I'm confident we'll compare very favorably on:
1. **Price**: Most competitors charge RM 5-10k/month for similar
2. **Guarantee**: We're the only ones offering 30-day money-back
3. **Simplicity**: Most systems are complex (staff hate them)
4. **Results**: We guarantee RM 15k savings (they don't)

Do your research, then let's talk Friday.

If we're the best option (which I think we will be), let's proceed.
If not, I totally understand.

Fair enough?"

[Schedule firm follow-up]
```

---

### They Say: "Let me think about it" (Vague)

**Response**:
```
YOU: "[Owner], I'm going to be direct with you because I respect your time.

'Think about it' usually means one of three things:
1. You're interested but have a concern you haven't shared
2. You're not interested but don't want to say no
3. You're genuinely undecided

Which one is it for you?

[Wait for honest answer]

[If #1]: "What's the concern? Let's address it right now."

[If #2]: "I appreciate your honesty! Can I ask what made you decide against it? Just for my learning."

[If #3]: "What would help you decide? More information, a demo, talking to a current client?"

Let's figure this out one way or the other, because 'maybe' helps neither of us.

What do you say?"
```

**Force Clarity**: You want YES or NO, not endless "maybe"

---

## ✅ CLOSING TECHNIQUES

### Technique 1: The Assumptive Close

```
YOU: "Based on everything we've discussed, this seems like a perfect fit for [Restaurant Name].

Here's what happens next:
1. I'll send the agreement this afternoon
2. You sign digitally (takes 2 minutes)
3. We schedule your onboarding for next week
4. Live within 30 days
5. Saving RM 15-25k monthly by Month 2

I'll send that agreement in the next hour. Sound good?"

[Assume the sale, proceed to logistics]
```

**When to Use**: Hot prospects, minimal objections

---

### Technique 2: The Alternative Close

```
YOU: "So we have two options for getting you started:

**Option A**: Standard setup (3-4 weeks, starts Month 2)
**Option B**: Rush setup (2 weeks, starts saving sooner)

Which would you prefer?"

[Both options = they're buying, just choosing implementation speed]
```

**When to Use**: Buyer is decided, just needs choice

---

### Technique 3: The Summary Close

```
YOU: "Let me make sure I understand where we are:

✅ You have the pain (losing RM 15-25k monthly to waste)
✅ You want the outcome (better margins, less waste)
✅ You like our solution (Waste Logging system)
✅ The ROI makes sense (RM 12-22k net benefit monthly)
✅ The guarantee removes all risk (30-day money-back)

Is there anything I'm missing, or can we move forward?"

[Should be: "Let's do it"]
```

**When to Use**: All objections addressed, just needs final push

---

### Technique 4: The Puppy Dog Close

```
YOU: "Look, I can tell you're interested but hesitant.

How about this: Let's get you started with a 30-day trial mindset.

You use the system for 30 days. If you love it, great - keep going.

If you're not blown away by the savings, just tell us and we refund you completely.

You literally cannot lose.

Worst case: You get 30 days of free waste tracking and savings data.
Best case: You save RM 15-25k monthly forever.

Can you think of any reason NOT to at least try it?

Let's get started!"
```

**When to Use**: Hesitant but qualified prospect

---

---

## 💡 FOLLOW-UP BEST PRACTICES

### Do's:
✅ **Be persistent** (3-5 touches minimum)  
✅ **Add value each time** (not just "checking in")  
✅ **Create urgency** (cost of inaction, limited slots)  
✅ **Ask direct questions** (not "just following up")  
✅ **Set specific next steps** (not vague "we'll be in touch")  
✅ **Track everything** (who, when, what, response)  

### Don'ts:
❌ **Be annoying** (daily messages)  
❌ **Be vague** ("touching base")  
❌ **Beg** ("please please decide")  
❌ **Give up too early** (need 3-5 touches)  
❌ **Follow up forever** (14 days max, then move on)  
❌ **Forget to ask for the close** (every follow-up should have a CTA)

## 🎁 BONUS: FOLLOW-UP TEMPLATES BY OBJECTION

### If Objection Was: "Too Expensive"

**Follow-Up Message**:
```
[Owner],

Been thinking about the "too expensive" concern.

Let me reframe it:

**Scenario 1** (You Don't Proceed):
• Monthly waste: RM 15-25k
• Cost to you: RM 0
• Lost profit: RM 15-25k
• **Annual loss: RM 180-300k**

**Scenario 2** (You Proceed):
• Investment: RM 2,997/month
• Savings: RM 15-25k/month
• **Annual profit increase: RM 144-264k**

Difference: **RM 324-564k over one year**

Still expensive, or actually the cheapest way to make RM 144-264k?

Plus 30-day guarantee = you risk nothing.

Ready to capture those savings?

Basyir
```

---

### If Objection Was: "Not Sure It Will Work"

**Follow-Up Message**:
```
[Owner],

Totally understand the skepticism. Let me address it:

**Proof It Works**:
1. Industry Data: 25-40% reduction (WRI 2023) - verified
2. Basic Logic: Can't improve what you don't measure
3. Our Guarantee: RM 15k savings or full refund

But here's the best proof: Let's do a FREE waste audit first.

We'll analyze your current waste for 7 days (no cost, no obligation).

You'll see the RM numbers in black and white.

THEN you decide if you want the full system.

Zero risk. Want to start with that?

## 🎯 BOTTOM LINE

**The follow-up is where deals are WON or LOST.**

- 80-90% of sales happen after follow-up #2 or later
- Most sales reps give up after 1-2 touches
- **You need 3-5 touches minimum**

**Keys to Success**:
1. **Be persistent** (but not annoying)
2. **Add value** each touch (not just "checking in")
3. **Create urgency** (cost of inaction)
4. **Remove risk** (guarantee)
5. **Force decision** (yes or no, not maybe)

**Remember**: Every "maybe" in your pipeline is costing them RM 15-25k monthly. 

**Your job**: Help them make a decision (either way).
