## 🎨 Design Decisions Explained

### **Why Teal (#00A7A7)?**
- Professional, trustworthy
- Stands out in F&B industry (most use red/orange)
- AG1 uses green - we adapted to teal for differentiation
- Works well with orange CTA buttons

### **Why Minimal Forms?**
- Higher conversion rates (every field = 10% drop in conversions)
- You're calling them anyway - why collect data upfront?
- Faster submission = more leads

### **Why Remove Testimonials?**
- You're a startup - fake testimonials hurt credibility
- Real data is more compelling
- Industry benchmarks set realistic expectations
- Verifiable sources build trust

### **Why Hormozi Pricing?**
