Based on [X outlets], I'd recommend [Tier].

- We guarantee results: 30-day money-back if not satisfied
- Risk-free: You only pay if you save money

Worth a quick demo to see if it's right for you?"

"That's great! Many of our clients started with [competitor].

Quick question: Are you hitting your waste reduction targets?

If there's room for improvement, we guarantee 30-40% reduction or you pay nothing. No risk to explore if we can do better.

10-minute call to compare?"

### "Not interested"
"No problem! May I ask - is waste reduction not a priority right now, or are you already handling it well?

[If handling well]: "Glad to hear! Mind sharing what's working? Always learning."

[If not priority]: "Understood. Quick heads up: every month costs you RM 15-25k in preventable waste. When timing is better, I'm here."
