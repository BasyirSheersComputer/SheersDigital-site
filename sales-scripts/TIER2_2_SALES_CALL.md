---

## 📋 PRE-CALL PREPARATION (10-15 Minutes)

### Deep Research Required:

- [ ] Confirm exact number of outlets (check all sources)
- [ ] Estimate revenue per outlet and total
- [ ] Identify all decision makers (Owner, Ops Manager, CFO?)
- [ ] Map out locations (which cities, clustered or spread?)
- [ ] Check current POS system (for integration planning)
- [ ] Review any expansion news (opening new outlets?)
- [ ] Understand cuisine/concept (helps with examples)
- [ ] Prepare 2-3 case studies from similar chains
- [ ] Review Growth System details (all 5 solutions)
- [ ] Calculate potential ROI specific to their scale

---

## 📞 PART 1: OPENING (2-3 Minutes)

### Step 1: Multi-Stakeholder Greeting (45 seconds)

```
YOU: "Hi [Owner Name]! It's Basyir from WasteWise. Thanks for making time!

I have you down for 15 minutes - is that still good?"

THEM: "Yes"

YOU: "Perfect! Quick question - is it just you, or do you have [Ops Manager/Partner] joining as well?"

[If just owner]:
YOU: "No problem! Though given we're discussing chain-wide operations, might be valuable to have your Ops Manager join. Can we schedule a follow-up with both of you, or shall we proceed just us?"

[If both]:
YOU: "Excellent! Hi [Ops Manager], thanks for joining too."
```

**Why This Matters**:
- Identifies all stakeholders early
- Gets buy-in from multiple decision makers
- Avoids "I need to discuss with [person]" later

---

### Step 2: Agenda & Credibility (60 seconds)

```
YOU: "Quick agenda for our time:
1. Understand your current multi-location setup (5 min)
2. Identify pain points as you scale (5 min)
3. Share how we help chains like yours standardize operations (5 min)
4. Discuss if a pilot program makes sense (5 min)

Sound good?"

THEM: "Yes"

YOU: "Great! Before we dive in, quick context on us:

We specialize in helping multi-location F&B chains - specifically [3-10] outlets - reduce waste and standardize operations across all locations.

Recent clients include chains in KL, Penang, JB with similar profiles to [Company].

Average result: 35-45% waste reduction, RM 35-50k monthly savings chain-wide.

But every chain is different, so I want to understand YOUR specific situation first.

Cool if I ask some questions?"
```

**What This Does**:
- Sets professional tone
- Establishes credibility (we work with chains)
- Creates curiosity (35-45% reduction)
- Gets permission to ask questions

---

## 📋 PART 2: MULTI-LOCATION DISCOVERY (5-7 Minutes)

### Phase A: Current State (2 minutes)

**Question 1: Operations Structure**
```
YOU: "So [Company] operates [X] outlets currently, correct? Can you walk me through the structure?

• Which locations?
• When did each open?
• Any plans for outlet #[X+1]?"

[Listen, take notes]

YOU: "Got it. And are all outlets company-owned, or do you have any franchise model?"
```

**Goal**: Understand complexity, growth trajectory, franchise implications

---

**Question 2: Current Systems & Processes**
```
YOU: "What systems are you currently using across outlets?

• Same POS everywhere, or different systems?
• How do you track inventory - centralized or per-location?
• Waste tracking - standardized or each outlet does their own thing?
• How do you communicate best practices across locations?"

[Listen for fragmentation signals]
```

**Goal**: Identify integration needs, standardization gaps

---

**Question 3: Operational Visibility**
```
YOU: "How often do you (or your ops team) visit each outlet?

And between visits, how do you know what's happening - daily reports, dashboards, or you just trust location managers?"

[Listen for visibility gaps]

YOU: "If outlet #[X] has a waste spike on Tuesday, when would you know about it - Tuesday evening, or not until your monthly review?"
```

**Goal**: Uncover visibility and response time issues

---

### Phase B: Pain Points & Challenges (2-3 minutes)

**Question 4: Scaling Pains (CRITICAL)**
```
YOU: "As you've scaled from outlet #1 to outlet #[X], what's been the biggest operational challenge?

What works great at one location but falls apart when you try to replicate it?"

[LISTEN CAREFULLY - this is gold]

Common responses:
- "Each outlet operates differently"
- "Can't be everywhere at once"
- "Some locations way more profitable than others"
- "Hard to identify what's working vs what's not"
- "Manager turnover disrupts operations"
```

---

**Question 5: Location Performance Variance**
```
YOU: "Of your [X] outlets, do you know which has:
• Lowest waste percentage?
• Highest profitability?
• Best operational efficiency?

And do you know WHY, or is it just 'that manager is better'?"

[Usually they don't know specifics]

YOU: "That's the challenge with multi-location - hard to know what's working where and why.

If you could replicate your best outlet's performance across all outlets, what would that mean for overall profitability?"
```

**Goal**: Quantify the opportunity (variance = money left on table)

---

### Phase C: Dream Outcome & Strategic Goals (2 minutes)

**Question 6: Expansion Plans**
```
YOU: "Where do you see [Company] in 12-24 months?

• How many outlets?
• New cities/regions?
• Different concepts?
• Franchise plans?"

[Listen to vision]
```

---

**Question 7: Operational Ideal State**
```
YOU: "Let's say it's 12 months from now and operations are running perfectly.

What does that look like?

• All outlets performing consistently?
• You have full visibility without being on-site?
• Best practices replicated automatically?
• New outlets ramping up faster?

What else?"

[Listen, note their exact language]

YOU: "Love that vision. So [repeat their ideal state] - that's the goal?

And what's blocking you from that today?"
```

**Goal**: Get dream outcome in THEIR words, identify true blockers

---

**Question 8: Decision Criteria**
```
YOU: "When you evaluate a solution like this, what matters most?

• ROI and savings?
• Ease of implementation?
• Staff adoption?
• Integration with current systems?
• Support and partnership?

Rank those for me."

[Listen - tells you how to position]
```

---

## 🎯 PART 3: PRESENT GROWTH SYSTEM (5-7 Minutes)

### Phase A: Problem Restatement (60 seconds)

```
YOU: "Okay, let me make sure I understand:

**Current Situation**:
• [X] outlets, doing roughly RM [total] monthly
• Each location somewhat autonomous (different tracking methods)
• You lack centralized visibility into performance
• Some outlets perform better than others (don't know why)
• Scaling is difficult (can't replicate success consistently)

**Desired Outcome**:
• Standardized operations across all locations
• Central visibility without micromanaging
• Best practices replicated automatically
• Confident to scale to [goal #] outlets

Did I capture that correctly?"

[Get confirmation]
```

---

### Phase B: Growth System Overview (90 seconds)

```
YOU: "Perfect! Here's exactly how we help multi-location chains achieve that:

**Growth System** - Complete WasteWise Platform:

Unlike our Quick Win package (single solution), Growth System includes ALL 5 solutions working together:

Make sense so far?"
```

---

### Phase C: Chain-Wide ROI (90 seconds)

```
YOU: "Here's the ROI for [Company]:

**Current State** (Your Numbers):
• [X] outlets × RM [avg] revenue each = RM [total]/month
• Typical multi-location food cost: 32-38%
• Food spend: ~RM [calculate] monthly
• Typical chain waste: 10-15% (higher than single outlets due to complexity)
• **Your estimated monthly waste**: RM 60-90k

**With WasteWise** (Conservative 35% reduction):
• Waste reduced by: 35%
• Monthly savings: RM 21-31k from waste alone
• Plus: Inventory optimization (RM 8-12k)
• Plus: Supplier negotiation power (RM 5-10k)
• **Total monthly savings**: RM 35-50k

**Investment**: RM 5,997/month

**Net Benefit**: RM 29-44k monthly
**Annual Impact**: RM 348-528k

**ROI**: 5-7x

That's significant for [Company], right?"

[Pause for reaction]
```

**Customize Numbers**: Use their actual data from discovery

---

### Phase D: Implementation for Multi-Location (90 seconds)

```
YOU: "Now, implementation across [X] outlets:

**Phase 1** (Month 1): Planning + Pilot
• Select 1-2 pilot locations
• Full implementation at pilot sites
• Prove the ROI
• Refine for your specific needs

**Phase 2** (Month 2): Rollout
• Roll out to remaining [X-2] locations
• Phased approach (2-3 locations per week)
• Your dedicated Success Manager coordinates everything

**Phase 3** (Month 3): Optimization
• All locations live
• Best practice sharing across chain
• Continuous improvement

**Timeline**: 45-60 days from contract to all locations operational

**Your Involvement**: Minimal (we handle the heavy lifting)

Questions on implementation?"
```

---

### Phase E: Dedicated Success Manager Value (60 seconds)

```
YOU: "One key differentiator for Growth System: You get a dedicated Success Manager.

This isn't just support - it's strategic partnership.

**Your Success Manager**:
• Named person (not a ticket queue)
• Knows your business and goals
• Bi-weekly check-ins (proactive, not reactive)
• Quarterly business reviews (strategic planning)
• Direct phone/WhatsApp line
• 2 on-site visits per year included

**Why This Matters**:
Most chains buy software and then struggle with adoption.

We partner with you to ensure results - not just sell you a tool.

Your success manager's job is literally to make sure you hit that RM 35-50k monthly savings target.

Make sense?"
```

---

## 🚧 PART 4: HANDLE TIER 2 OBJECTIONS (3-5 Minutes)

### Objection 1: "That's significantly more than we planned to invest"

**Response**:
```
YOU: "I understand - RM 5,997/month is an investment.

But let's look at it from a chain perspective:

**Per Outlet Cost**:
• Total: RM 5,997/month
• [X] outlets = RM [5,997/X]/outlet/month

So you're paying RM [amount] per outlet for a complete system that saves you RM 35-50k monthly chain-wide.

**Per Outlet ROI**:
• Cost: RM [5,997/X]/outlet
• Savings: RM [35k-50k/X]/outlet
• Net: RM [calculate]/outlet profit improvement

And remember: We guarantee RM 30k savings in 60 days or you pay nothing.

So the real question: Can you afford to keep losing RM 35-50k every month?

Perspective shift help?"
```

---

### Objection 2: "We'd want to start with just 1-2 outlets first"

**Response**:
```
YOU: "Smart approach! That's exactly what we do.

The pilot program:

**Month 1-2**: Implement at 2 pilot locations
• Prove the ROI
• Test staff adoption
• Refine for your processes
• Validate savings (RM 30k guarantee applies)

**Month 3**: If results are there, roll out to remaining outlets

**Pricing**:
• Full Growth System price from day 1 (RM 5,997/mo)
• BUT: 60-day guarantee (RM 30k savings or refund)
• So you're protected even during pilot

Make sense?

This way you validate with minimal risk, then scale to all outlets.

Ready to start with a 2-location pilot?"
```

---

### Objection 3: "We need to see if it works with our POS/systems"

**Response**:
```
YOU: "Absolutely! Integration is critical for multi-location.

What POS are you using across outlets?

[Listen]

YOU: "Great! We integrate with [POS name]:
• Standard integration: 7-10 days
• Works with [specific features]
• No disruption to current operations

As part of the pilot, we'd do full integration testing at your pilot locations.

If integration doesn't work smoothly, the 60-day guarantee kicks in - you get refunded.

So you're protected on the technical risk too.

Want to schedule a technical review with our integration team before committing? They can assess your setup in 30 minutes."
```

---

### Objection 4: "How do we know our staff will actually use it?"

**Response**:
```
YOU: "THE most important question! Software only works if staff use it.

Here's how we ensure adoption:

**1. Simplicity**: 30 seconds to log waste (mobile app)
• Not complex dashboards staff hate
• Quick, simple, mobile-first

**2. Manager Training** (4 hours per location):
• Hands-on, practical
• Your operations, not generic
• Certification program

**3. Staff Training** (2 hours per location):
• Frontline user training
• Why it matters (their tips improve if waste goes down)
• Gamification (best practices shared chain-wide)

**4. Dedicated Success Manager**:
• Weekly check-ins first month
• Identifies adoption issues early
• Provides solutions proactively

**5. Proven Track Record**:
• 90%+ staff adoption across our clients
• Staff actually like it (makes their job easier)

Plus, the pilot lets you test this with 2 locations before committing chain-wide.

Does that address the concern?"
```

---

### Objection 5: "We're in the middle of other initiatives"

**Response**:
```
YOU: "I totally get it - growth-stage chains always have multiple priorities.

Can I ask - what are the other initiatives?

[Listen]

YOU: "Those sound important! Here's my question:

Would waste reduction and operational standardization SUPPORT those initiatives or conflict with them?

Because if you're [opening new outlets / improving profitability / preparing for franchise], having solid waste tracking is actually foundational to those goals.

What if we implement alongside your other initiatives?

Our implementation is designed for busy operations - we handle the heavy lifting, minimal disruption to your team.

Worth piloting now so you have the foundation as you execute on [their other initiative]?"
```

---

## 🎁 PART 5: PRESENT PILOT PROGRAM (2-3 Minutes)

### The Strategic Pilot Proposal:

```
YOU: "Given [Company]'s scale and sophistication, I recommend starting with a pilot program.

**Here's How It Works**:

**Pilot Locations**: 2 outlets
• We help you select (typically 1 high-performer + 1 struggling)
• Full Growth System implementation
• 45-day pilot period

**What We Prove**:
• Exact savings per outlet (RM numbers)
• Staff adoption (do they use it?)
• Integration success (works with your systems?)
• Scalability (can we replicate chain-wide?)

**Investment During Pilot**:
• Same as full: RM 5,997/month
• 60-day guarantee: RM 30k savings or full refund
• So you're protected

**After Pilot** (If Successful):
• Roll out to remaining [X-2] outlets
• Phased implementation (2-3 per week)
• Achieve RM 35-50k monthly savings chain-wide

**After Pilot** (If Not Successful):
• Get full refund (guarantee)
• No hard feelings
• You lose nothing

Make sense?"

[Pause for response]
```

---

### Why Pilot Program Works for Tier 2:

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Lower risk (test before full rollout)
- ✅ Proof of concept (validate ROI)
- ✅ Learn from pilot (refine for other outlets)
- ✅ Build internal buy-in (staff see it works)
- ✅ Easier decision (pilot vs all-in)

**Your Positioning**:
```
YOU: "The pilot is designed for chains like yours who are too sophisticated to just 'try and see.'

You need proof. We provide it.

60 days, 2 locations, RM 30k savings guarantee.

If we deliver, we earn the right to help all your outlets.
If we don't, you've lost nothing.

Ready to start the pilot?"
```

---

## 💰 PART 6: CHAIN-WIDE ROI PRESENTATION (2 Minutes)

### The Outlet-by-Outlet Breakdown:

```
YOU: "Let me show you the per-outlet economics:

**Pilot Outlets** (2 locations × 60 days):
• Expected savings per outlet: RM 15-18k/month
• × 2 outlets = RM 30-36k/month
• Investment: RM 5,997/month
• **Net benefit during pilot: RM 24-30k/month**

**Full Rollout** (All [X] outlets):
• Savings per outlet: RM 15-18k/month  
• × [X] outlets = RM [calculate] monthly
• Investment: Still RM 5,997/month (same price)
• **Net benefit: RM [calculate] monthly**

**Annual Impact**:
• Year 1 savings: RM [monthly × 12]
• Less investment: RM 72k
• **Net profit increase: RM [calculate]**

That's like adding [calculate: net profit / avg outlet revenue] outlets worth of profit WITHOUT opening new locations.

Make sense for [Company]'s growth goals?"
```

---

## 🔍 PART 7: DISCOVERY DEEP-DIVE QUESTIONS

### Question 9: Competitive Positioning
```
YOU: "How do you differentiate [Company] from competitors?

And if you could improve margins by 10-15% without compromising quality, how would that strengthen your competitive position?"
```

---

### Question 10: Franchise/Expansion Readiness
```
YOU: "You mentioned plans for [X more] outlets. 

Before you open outlet #[X+1], what operational systems do you need to have in place to ensure it's profitable from month one?"

[Listen - often includes waste tracking]
```

---

### Question 11: Team Capacity
```
YOU: "Does your operations team have bandwidth to implement new systems, or would you need us to handle most of it?"

[If limited bandwidth]:
YOU: "Perfect - our implementation model is white-glove. We handle 90% of the work. Your team just needs to be available for decisions and training."
```

---

## 🎯 PART 8: CLOSE OR ADVANCE (3 Minutes)

### The Pilot Close (Best for Tier 2):

```
YOU: "Based on everything we've discussed:

✅ You have the pain (inconsistent operations, limited visibility)
✅ You want the outcome (standardized, scalable operations)
✅ The ROI is compelling (RM 29-44k net monthly)
✅ The pilot proves results (2 outlets, 60 days, guaranteed)
✅ Minimal risk (RM 30k guarantee)

Honestly, the pilot is a no-brainer.

**Next Steps**:
1. We select your 2 pilot locations (this week)
2. Kickoff meeting with key stakeholders (next week)
3. Implementation at pilot sites (Month 1)
4. Prove RM 30k savings (Month 2)
5. Roll out to all outlets (Month 3)

Shall we get the pilot started?"

[PAUSE. SILENCE. Wait for response.]
```

---

### The Multi-Stakeholder Close:

```
YOU: "I'm hearing strong interest from both of you.

[Owner], you're focused on [their goal - profitability/expansion]
[Ops Manager], you're focused on [their goal - standardization/efficiency]

Our Growth System solves both.

Is there anything preventing us from starting the pilot?

[If no]:
YOU: "Great! I'll send over pilot agreement and implementation timeline today. We can kick off as early as next week."

[If yes - objection]:
YOU: [Handle objection, see above]

[If need to discuss]:
YOU: "What would you two need to discuss to make a decision? And when would that conversation happen?"
```

---

### The Alternative Advancement (If Not Ready to Pilot):

```
YOU: "I'm sensing you're interested but not quite ready for the pilot.

What would be the best next step?

**Option A**: Detailed proposal with full ROI analysis (I send by EOD, we review Friday)

**Option B**: Technical review call (30 min with our integration team to confirm compatibility)

**Option C**: Reference call (speak with similar chain using our system)

**Option D**: On-site visit (I visit your best-performing outlet to see operations firsthand, then customize proposal)

Which would be most valuable for making a decision?"

[They choose, schedule next step]
