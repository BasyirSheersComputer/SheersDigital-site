## 💡 BEST PRACTICES ACROSS ALL TIERS

### Universal Do's:
✅ **Personalize every message** (research, use their name, specific details)  
✅ **Lead with outcomes** (save RM X, reduce Y%)  
✅ **Quantify everything** (specific numbers, not ranges)  
✅ **Remove risk** (guarantees, trial periods)  
✅ **Ask for close** (don't wait for them to volunteer)  
✅ **Follow up persistently** (3-10 touches depending on tier)  
✅ **Track religiously** (CRM, spreadsheet, notes)  

### Universal Don'ts:
❌ **Generic messages** (instant delete)  
❌ **Feature dumping** (they don't care)  
❌ **Being pushy** (backfires, especially enterprise)  
❌ **Giving up early** (most sales happen after touch 3-5)  
❌ **Ignoring objections** (address head-on)  
❌ **Vague next steps** (always specific date/time/action)

## 💼 ENTERPRISE-SPECIFIC NOTES

**Enterprise is Different** (Tier 3):

⚠️ **Longer Cycles** (2-6 months vs 2-4 weeks)  
⚠️ **More Stakeholders** (CEO, COO, CFO, Legal, IT, Board)  
⚠️ **Formal Process** (RFP, legal review, procurement)  
⚠️ **Higher Bar** (must be strategic, not just tactical)  
⚠️ **Lower Response Rate** (5-15% vs 25-35%)  

✅ **But**: 5-20x higher value per customer  
✅ **Worth It**: One enterprise = 5-15 SME customers in revenue  

**Strategy**: Patient, professional, persistent

---

## 🎯 ROLE-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE

### For Founder/CEO (You're Selling):
- Focus on: Tier 1 + Tier 2 (easier to close)
