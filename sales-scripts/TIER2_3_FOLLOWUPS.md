Basyir
+60 11-6326 3808
```

---

## 📱 FOLLOW-UP #2: 48 HOURS (Gentle Check-In)

```
Hi [Owner/Ops Manager],

Quick check-in: Did everyone get a chance to review the pilot proposal?

Any initial questions, or anything that wasn't clear?

Still on for our Friday call to discuss next steps!

Basyir
```

**If They Respond with Questions**:
- Answer thoroughly and professionally
- CC all stakeholders (keep everyone in loop)
- Always end with: "Does that help? Ready to move forward with the pilot?"

---

## 📞 FOLLOW-UP #3: 5 DAYS (Scheduled Review Call)

### Opening:

```
YOU: "Hi [Owner] and [Ops Manager]! Thanks for making time again.

So you've had almost a week with the pilot proposal.

What questions have come up?"

[LISTEN. Take notes. Address each question.]
```

---

### If Questions Answered, Push for Decision:

```
YOU: "Great questions! Anything else before we proceed?

[If no more questions]:

YOU: "Excellent! So we've covered:
✓ How the pilot works
✓ The ROI (RM 29-44k net monthly)
✓ The guarantee (RM 30k or refund)
✓ Implementation process
✓ [Any other concerns they raised]

Are we ready to start the pilot, or is there something else you need?"

[If ready]:
YOU: "Fantastic! I'll send the pilot agreement today. Once signed, we'll schedule kickoff for next week. Your team will be trained and live within 30 days at the 2 pilot locations."

[If not ready]:
YOU: "What specifically are you waiting for or needing to know before you can commit to the pilot?"

[Listen, address, close again]
```

---

### If They're Stalling:

```
YOU: "Let me be direct: I'm sensing hesitation beyond just normal due diligence.

What's the real concern here?

Is it:
• The investment (RM 5,997/mo)?
• Doubt it'll work for your chain specifically?
• Implementation disruption?
• Internal politics?
• Something else?

I'd rather address it head-on than keep dancing around it.

What's really stopping you?"

[Get honest answer, address root cause]
```

---

### Handling Multi-Stakeholder Disagreement:

```
[If Owner wants to proceed but Ops Manager hesitant, or vice versa]:

YOU: "[Owner], you seem ready. [Ops Manager], I'm sensing hesitation. Can you share your concern?"

OPS MANAGER: "[Specific concern - usually implementation, staff adoption, or tech integration]"

YOU: "That's a valid concern. Here's how we address that:

[Provide specific solution]

Does that resolve it, or is there something else?"

[Work to get alignment between stakeholders]

YOU: "What would both of you need to be fully aligned and comfortable moving forward with the pilot?"

[Address remaining concerns, get commitment]
```

---

## 📱 FOLLOW-UP #4: 10 DAYS (Urgency + Value)

```
Hi [Owner],

Quick update: We have just 2 pilot slots left for [Month] onboarding.

After that, next available is [Month+1] - meaning your savings start 30 days later.

30 days = another RM 35-50k lost to waste while you wait.

I've held a slot for [Company], but I need to know by end of week if you're proceeding.

Where are you in the decision process?

If you're ready: Let's lock in the pilot slot
If you need more info: Let's jump on a call this week
If you're not interested: Let me know and I'll stop following up

What's the status?

Basyir
+60 11-6326 3808
```

**Creates Urgency**: Limited slots, cost of delay

---

## 📞 FOLLOW-UP #5: 14 DAYS (Decision-Forcing Call)

### Call Structure:

```
YOU: "Hi [Owner]! It's been 2 weeks since our proposal call.

I'm calling to get a clear YES or NO so we can both move forward one way or another.

Where are you in the decision process?"

[Listen carefully]

THEM: "Still discussing internally" [or similar stall]

YOU: "I appreciate that. Let me ask - what hasn't been discussed yet that needs to be?

[Listen]

YOU: "Okay, when will that discussion happen?"

THEM: "Next week"

YOU: "Perfect! So if [discussion topic] goes well next week, you're ready to start the pilot?"

THEM: [Should be yes]

YOU: "Great! Here's what I suggest:

Let's schedule a 15-minute decision call for next [specific day]. 

By then, you'll have discussed [their topic], and we can either:
A) Start the pilot (I'll have onboarding team ready)
B) Decide it's not the right fit (no hard feelings)

But no more 'we're thinking about it' after that. We need a firm YES or NO.

Fair enough?"

[Get commitment to decision timeline]
```

---

### If They're Genuinely Stuck on Something:

```
YOU: "What would help you make a decision?

• Reference call with [similar chain we work with]?
• Technical deep-dive with our integration team?
• On-site visit to see your operations firsthand?
• Pilot with just 1 outlet instead of 2?
• Different guarantee structure?

I want to make this easy for you. What's the missing piece?"

[Provide what they need, set firm decision deadline]
```

---

## 📱 FOLLOW-UP #6: 21 DAYS (The Breakup)

```
Hi [Owner],

It's been 3 weeks since our call about the pilot program for [Company].

Haven't heard back, so I'm assuming one of these:
1. Not the right timing
2. Not interested  
3. Went with another solution
4. Internal decision not finalized

All are fine!

I'm going to close your file and stop following up.

If I'm wrong and you DO want to proceed with the pilot, please let me know by Friday.

Otherwise, I'll check back in 6 months when you might have [more outlets / different priorities / better timing].

Best of luck scaling [Company]! You've built something impressive.

Basyir
+60 11-6326 3808
```

**Take-Away Psychology**: Often triggers response when nothing else did

---

### Common Responses to Breakup:

**"Sorry, been slammed! Yes, let's proceed with pilot"**
```
YOU: "No worries at all! Multi-location chains are always busy.

Good news: We can still get you into [Month] pilot cohort if you can commit by Friday.

Can you sign the pilot agreement this week?"

[Send agreement, close]
```

---

**"Can I have another week?"**
```
YOU: "I can give you until Friday next week, but that's the absolute limit.

After that, I have to allocate implementation resources to other clients and you'd wait another month.

3+ weeks deliberating while losing RM 35-50k monthly doesn't make business sense.

With the RM 30k guarantee, what's really holding you back?

Let's address that now so you can decide - yes or no - not 'another week.'"

[Force the real objection, address it, close]
```

---

## 🎯 MULTI-STAKEHOLDER FOLLOW-UP TACTICS

### Tactic 1: The Individual Check-In

**After group call, follow up individually**:

**To Owner** (Focus on Strategic Value):
```
Hi [Owner],

Following up on the pilot proposal.

Quick question from strategic perspective: 

If we prove RM 30k+ savings during the 2-outlet pilot, what's the path to rolling out chain-wide?

Want to make sure we're aligned on success criteria and next steps before we start.

10-minute call just you and I this week?

Basyir
```

**To Ops Manager** (Focus on Implementation):
```
Hi [Ops Manager],

Following up on pilot proposal.

From operations perspective, any concerns about implementation across the 2 pilot outlets?

Happy to jump on a quick technical review call with you and our implementation team.

Would that help with your internal decision?

Basyir
```

**Why This Works**:
- Address each stakeholder's specific concerns
- Build individual relationships
- Increase overall buy-in
- Identify who's champion vs blocker

---

### Tactic 2: The Pilot Location Selection

**Proactively suggest pilot locations**:

```
Hi [Owner/Ops Manager],

Been thinking about your pilot locations.

Based on our discussion, I'd recommend:

**Pilot Location 1**: [High-performing outlet]
• Why: Prove the system works even for your best outlet
• Goal: Show there's always room for improvement

**Pilot Location 2**: [Struggling outlet]
• Why: Show dramatic results where needed most
• Goal: Bring this outlet up to par with best performers

This gives you:
• Proof it works for high AND low performers
• Clear before/after comparison
• Confidence to roll out everywhere

Thoughts? Or would you prefer different pilot locations?

Basyir
```

**Why This Works**:
- Shows you listened and thought about their business
- Makes pilot feel more real (specific locations)
- Moves conversation to implementation (assumptive close)

---

### Tactic 3: The Chain-Wide Vision

**Paint picture of success across ALL outlets**:

```
Hi [Owner],

Quick visualization for you:

**Today**:
• [X] outlets, each doing their own thing
• Some waste 8%, some waste 15%
• No visibility without visiting
• Hard to scale best practices

**90 Days from Now** (After Pilot + Rollout):
• All [X] outlets on same system
• Centralized dashboard (visibility from anywhere)
• Best performers' practices automatically shared
• Waste reduced to 6-8% across ALL outlets
• Saving RM 35-50k monthly
• Ready to scale to outlets [X+1] through [X+5]

That's the transformation we're offering.

Ready to start the pilot so you can achieve that vision?

Basyir
```

---

## 🔥 ADVANCED TIER 2 CLOSING TACTICS

### Tactic 1: The Pilot Economics

**Break down pilot ROI specifically**:

```
Let me walk you through the pilot economics specifically:

**Pilot Investment** (60 days):
• Month 1: RM 5,997
• Month 2: RM 5,997
• Total: RM 11,994

**Pilot Savings** (2 outlets × RM 15k each):
• Month 1: RM 10-15k (ramp up)
• Month 2: RM 25-30k (full results)
• Total: RM 35-45k

**Pilot Net Benefit**: RM 23-33k

Even during the PILOT, you're RM 23-33k ahead.

Then when you roll out to all [X] outlets: RM 29-44k net monthly forever.

This is the easiest ROI decision you'll make this year.

What's holding you back from starting the pilot?"
```

---

### Tactic 2: The Competitive Disadvantage

**Frame delay as competitive risk**:

```
[Owner],

While you're deliberating, here's what's happening:

Your competitors who implement waste tracking are operating at 25-30% food cost.

If you're at 35-40% (typical for chains without tracking), they have a 5-10% margin advantage.

Over 12 months, that's the difference between:
• Opening 2 new outlets (you have the profit)
• vs. Staying at [X] outlets (competitors expand)

Every month you delay, they pull further ahead.

The pilot proves whether this gives [Company] that competitive edge.

60 days, guaranteed results, zero risk.

Why not at least try?

Basyir
```

---

### Tactic 3: The Reference Call Offer

**If they're hesitant, offer social proof**:

```
Hi [Owner],

Sensing you're still on the fence about the pilot.

How about this: I'll connect you with [Name], Operations Director at [Similar Chain].

They run [X] outlets (similar to you) and have been using our Growth System for [X] months.

You can ask them anything:
• Real results (not our marketing claims)
• Implementation challenges
• Staff adoption
• Whether it's worth it

15-minute call with them - no obligation to us.

If they say it's great, you start the pilot.
If they say it's not worth it, you walk away.

Fair?

I'll set it up if you're interested.

Basyir
```

## 💡 NAVIGATING MULTI-STAKEHOLDER DYNAMICS

### Scenario: Owner Says Yes, Ops Manager Says No

**Your Response**:
```
YOU: "I appreciate both perspectives.

[Owner], you see the strategic value - better margins, scalability.
[Ops Manager], you're concerned about [their concern - usually implementation or staff].

Let's address [Ops Manager]'s concern directly:

[Provide solution]

[Ops Manager], if we solve [concern], are you comfortable proceeding?"

[Get their buy-in]

YOU: "Perfect! So we're aligned then?"

[Get group commitment]
```

---

### Scenario: CFO Needs to Approve

**Your Response**:
```
"Makes total sense - RM 5,997/month is a budget decision.

Can we get CFO on our next call, or would it be easier if I sent them a financial analysis directly?

[If join call]:
"Perfect! When's good for all three of you?"

[If send analysis]:
"No problem! I'll send CFO-specific ROI analysis focusing on:
• Cash flow impact (+RM 29-44k monthly)
• Payback period (negative - cash positive from month 1)
• Annual profit increase (RM 348-528k)
• Risk mitigation (RM 30k guarantee)

What's CFO's email?"

## 🎯 DECISION-FORCING QUESTIONS

### Use These to Get Clarity:

**Question 1: The Timeline Lock**
```
"When do you need to make a decision by - internally? What's your decision process and timeline?"

[Get specific date]

"Okay, so by [date] you'll have decided. If we start the pilot by [date+7], you'd be seeing results by [date+60]. If that timeline works, what do you need from me between now and [decision date] to help you decide?"
```

---

**Question 2: The Blocker Identification**
```
"If money wasn't an issue and you were 100% confident it would work, would you start the pilot tomorrow?"

[If yes]: "Okay, so it's about [money / confidence]. Let's address that specifically."

[If no]: "What else is the concern then?"

[Keep peeling until you find real blocker]
```

---

**Question 3: The Alternative Identification**
```
"Are you evaluating other solutions alongside ours, or is this the only option you're considering?

[If others]: "Happy to do a side-by-side comparison. Who are we being compared against?"

[If just us]: "So it's not us vs competitor, it's us vs doing nothing / continuing current approach?"

[Frame the decision correctly, address the real comparison]
```

## 🏆 TIER 2 SUCCESS PATTERNS

### What Works Best for Tier 2:

✅ **Pilot Program** (not full commitment) - 70% prefer this  
✅ **ROI Focus** (CFO-level financials) - 90% want this  
✅ **Reference Calls** (peer validation) - 60% request this  
✅ **Technical Review** (integration validation) - 40% need this  
✅ **Multi-Stakeholder Alignment** (everyone on same page) - 100% required  

### What Doesn't Work:

❌ **Pushy tactics** (they're sophisticated, see through it)  
❌ **Feature dumping** (they want outcomes, not features)  
❌ **One-size-fits-all** (they need customized approach)  
❌ **Ignoring stakeholders** (Ops Manager kills deal if ignored)  
❌ **Rushing decision** (they need time, respect that)
