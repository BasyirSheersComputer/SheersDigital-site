# Tier 2 (Growth System) - Cold Intro Script
## Goal: Set 15-Minute Strategic Call

**Target ICP**: Multi-location chains (3-10 outlets), RM 200k-1M/mo revenue  
**Decision Maker**: Owner + Ops Manager (collaborative decision)  
**Channel**: WhatsApp, Email, LinkedIn  
**Time Required**: 5-10 minutes to research + personalize

## 🎯 SCRIPT OBJECTIVE

**Primary Goal**: Get 15-minute strategic call with decision makers

**Key Difference from Tier 1**:
- More research required (multi-location = complex)
- Longer sales cycle (collaborative decision)
- Focus on SCALING pain (not just waste)
- Higher value conversation (RM 35-50k savings)

## 📧 EMAIL COLD INTRO (Important for Tier 2)

### Subject Lines:

**Option 1** (Scaling): [Company] - Standardizing operations across [X] locations  
**Option 2** (Results): Save RM 35-50k monthly across your [X] outlets?  
**Option 3** (Peer): How [Similar Chain] achieved 38% waste reduction

### Email Template:

```
Subject: [Company Name] - Standardizing operations across [X] locations

Hi [Owner/Ops Manager Name],

I came across [Company Name] and was impressed by your growth to [X] locations in [Y] years. That's no small feat in the competitive F&B space.

As someone who helps multi-location restaurants scale profitably, I wanted to reach out.

**The Scaling Challenge I See Often:**

Most chains struggle with operational consistency across locations:
• Each outlet tracks waste differently (or not at all)
• No centralized visibility into performance by location
• Can't identify which outlets are most/least efficient
• Difficult to replicate best practices chain-wide

The result? Waste that should be 25-30% per outlet balloons to 40-50% at some locations.

**How We Help Multi-Location Chains:**

Our Growth System gives you:

✓ **Centralized Dashboard**: See all outlets in one view
✓ **Location Comparison**: Identify best and worst performers
✓ **Standardized Tracking**: Same system, same process everywhere
✓ **Dedicated Success Manager**: Strategic partner for scaling

**Results**: 35-45% waste reduction chain-wide, RM 35-50k monthly savings

**Recent Example**: [Similar Chain Name] (5 locations in Selangor) achieved 38% reduction in 90 days, saving RM 42k monthly.

**Worth a 15-minute strategic call?**

I'd love to understand [Company]'s specific challenges and share what's worked for similar chains.

You can book directly: [Calendly Link]
Or reply with a good time and I'll send an invite.

## 🎤 PHONE COLD CALL (If You Get Through)

### Opening (First 30 seconds):

```
[Phone rings, gatekeeper answers]

GATEKEEPER: "[Company Name], how may I help you?"

YOU: "Hi! This is Basyir from WasteWise. May I speak with [Owner Name] or the Operations Manager please?"

GATEKEEPER: "What's this regarding?"

YOU: "It's regarding operational efficiency across your [X] locations. We help multi-location restaurants reduce waste and standardize operations. Who would be the best person to speak with about that?"

GATEKEEPER: "That would be [Name], but they're busy. Can I take a message?"

YOU: "Sure! Please let [Name] know that Basyir from WasteWise called regarding potential RM 35-50k monthly savings through waste reduction across all outlets.

My number is +60 11-6326 3808. When's a good time to call back - morning or afternoon?"

[Get specific time, call back then]
```

---

### If You Reach Decision Maker:

```
YOU: "Hi [Name]! This is Basyir from WasteWise. Is now a bad time, or do you have 3 minutes for a quick question?"

[If bad time]: "When's better - tomorrow morning or Thursday afternoon?"

[If they say okay]:

YOU: "Great! I'll be quick. I work with multi-location F&B chains on operational efficiency.

I noticed [Company] has grown to [X] locations. As you've scaled, are you finding it challenging to get consistent waste tracking and operations across all outlets?"

[Listen to response]

YOU: "That's very common. Most chains struggle with this.

We help multi-location restaurants achieve 35-45% waste reduction across all outlets through centralized visibility and standardized processes.

Recent example: [Similar Chain] with 5 locations reduced waste 38% and saves RM 42k monthly.

Would 15 minutes be worth it to see if we can help [Company] achieve similar results?

I'm not pitching you on this call - just want to understand your situation and see if there's a fit."

[Schedule strategic call]
```

---

## 🚫 HANDLING TIER 2 OBJECTIONS (Cold Intro Stage)

### "We already have systems in place"

**Response**:
```
"That's great! Can I ask - are those systems giving you chain-wide visibility, or does each location use different tools?

[Listen]

What we find with most chains: Systems in place, but they're fragmented. Each location does its own thing.

Our value is centralization + standardization.

Worth 15 minutes to see if we can improve on what you already have?

Not asking you to rip and replace - just explore if there's room for improvement."
```

---

### "Send me information first"

**Response**:
```
"Happy to! But given you operate [X] locations, the information that's relevant for you is very different from a single-outlet operator.

Better if we jump on a quick 15-minute call where I understand your specific multi-location challenges, then send you customized information.

Otherwise I'm sending you generic stuff that might not even apply.

Tuesday at 10am or Thursday at 2pm?"
```

---

### "We don't have that kind of budget"

**Response**:
```
"I haven't even told you the investment yet! 😊

But here's what I can share: Most multi-location chains save RM 35-50k monthly with our system.

Investment is RM 5,997/month - so you're netting RM 29-44k monthly.

Plus we guarantee RM 30k savings in 60 days or you pay nothing.

So it actually MAKES you money, not costs you money.

Worth 15 minutes to run the numbers specific to your [X] outlets?"
```

Hi [Name],

Not sure if you saw my message about waste reduction across [Company]'s [X] locations?

Quick summary: We help multi-location chains save RM 35-50k monthly through centralized waste visibility.

Recent client ([Similar Chain] - 5 locations) achieved RM 42k monthly savings in 90 days.

```

---

### Follow-Up #2 (5 days after initial):

```
[Name],

Last follow-up, I promise!

Did some quick math on [Company]:

[X] outlets × RM [avg revenue per outlet] = RM [total] monthly
Typical waste at 10-12% = **RM [calculate] monthly loss**

We help chains like yours reduce that by 35-45%.

Potential savings: **RM 35-50k monthly**

Even if you're skeptical, worth 15 minutes to explore?

We guarantee RM 30k savings in 60 days or you pay nothing - so zero risk to at least have the conversation.

Tuesday or Thursday this week work for a quick call?

```

---

### Follow-Up #3 (10 days after initial, FINAL):

```
Hi [Name],

I'll stop reaching out after this!

Just wanted to share: We're onboarding 3 multi-location chains this month.

All of them wish they'd started earlier - one said "We've wasted RM 200k over the past year because we delayed 6 months."

If you're interested in exploring how [Company] can save RM 35-50k monthly, I'm here.

If not, no worries! I'll check back in 6 months to see if timing's better.

When should I follow up - 3 months or 6 months?

Best regards,
Basyir
```

## 📈 TIER 2 RESPONSE RATES (Expected)

**WhatsApp**: 20-30% (slightly lower than Tier 1 - harder to reach)  
**Email**: 15-25%  
**LinkedIn**: 30-40% (for professional ops managers)  
**Phone**: 35-45% (if you get past gatekeeper)  

**Conversion to Call**: 30-50% of responses (more vetting required)

**Why Lower Than Tier 1?**:

**Solution**: More follow-ups needed (4-6 vs 3-5 for Tier 1)

---

## 💡 TIER 2 PERSONALIZATION (CRITICAL)

**Tier 2 prospects are sophisticated. Generic = ignored.**

### Research Before Outreach (10 min per lead):

✅ **Location Count** (confirm exact number)
- Check website "Locations" page
- Count Google Business listings
- Check Facebook/Instagram location tags

✅ **Recent News** (expansion, funding, awards)
- Google: "[Company Name] Malaysia news"
- Check: press releases, media mentions

✅ **Growth Indicators**
- Job postings (hiring for new locations?)
- Social media (grand opening announcements?)
- Industry recognition (awards, best-of lists)

✅ **Current Tech Stack**
- Visit restaurant: What POS do they use?
- Check website: Any tech mentions?
- LinkedIn: Do they have IT/Ops roles?

✅ **Decision Makers**
- LinkedIn: Search "[Company Name] Malaysia owner"
- LinkedIn: Search "[Company Name] operations manager"
- Website: "Our Team" or "About Us" page

---

### Personalization Examples (Add 2-3 to Message):

✅ **Recent Expansion**:
"Congrats on opening the new [Location Name] outlet last month!"

✅ **Award/Recognition**:
"Saw you won [Award Name] - well deserved!"

✅ **Job Posting**:
"Noticed you're hiring for [Position] - sign of healthy growth!"

✅ **Social Media**:
"Your Instagram following grew 30% this year - impressive marketing!"

✅ **Review/Rating**:
"Consistent 4.5+ ratings across all outlets - that's rare for multi-location chains!"

✅ **Specific Location**:
"The [Specific Location] outlet is beautifully designed - saw the photos!"

**Rule**: Never send a generic message to Tier 2. They can tell, and they'll ignore you.

## 🎯 TIER 2 CALL SETTING TACTICS

### Tactic 1: The Multi-Threaded Approach

**Reach out to BOTH Owner AND Ops Manager** (separately):

**To Owner**:
```
Hi [Owner Name],

[Company]'s growth to [X] locations is impressive! 

As you scale, finding it challenging to maintain operational consistency across all outlets?

Worth a brief call to share what works for multi-location chains like yours.

15 minutes this week?

Basyir
```

**To Ops Manager** (same day):
```
Hi [Ops Manager Name],

I help multi-location F&B chains standardize operations and reduce waste across all outlets.

[Company]'s [X] locations likely face challenges like inconsistent tracking, location-by-location differences, and difficulty scaling best practices.

Worth 15 minutes to explore solutions?

Basyir
```

**Why This Works**:
- Increases response probability
- Gets multiple perspectives
- Shows you did research
- One might loop in the other

---

### Tactic 2: The Peer Reference

**Mention similar chain (without naming if confidential)**:

```
Hi [Name],

Work with a similar [cuisine type] chain in [region] - [X] locations like yours.

They were struggling with inconsistent waste tracking across outlets.

Helped them centralize visibility and reduce waste 38% chain-wide.

Now saving RM 42k monthly.

Worth 15 minutes to see if similar results are possible for [Company]?

Basyir
```

**Why This Works**:
- Social proof (someone like them did it)
- Specific results (credible)
- Implies you understand their business

---

### Tactic 3: The Franchise/Growth Hook

**For chains planning to franchise**:

```
Hi [Owner],

Noticed [Company] is expanding rapidly - [X] locations now.

Planning to franchise eventually?

Before most chains franchise, they need:
1. Standardized operations across ALL locations
2. Centralized tracking and visibility
3. Proven profitability per outlet

We help growth-stage chains build franchise-ready operations through:
• Centralized waste + inventory management
• Performance benchmarking across locations
• Standardized processes (replicable)

Worth 15 minutes to discuss your franchise readiness?

Basyir
```

**When to Use**:
- Growth trajectory is aggressive
- Multiple locations opening
- Industry buzz about their expansion

## 🎯 SPECIAL TIER 2 TACTICS

### Tactic 1: The Outlet Comparison Hook

```
"Quick question: Of your [X] outlets, do you know which one has the highest waste percentage vs lowest?

Most chains we work with don't have that visibility.

That's what we solve - you'd know exactly which outlets are most/least efficient, and can replicate best practices chain-wide.

Worth exploring?"
```

---

### Tactic 2: The Expansion Readiness

```
"I see [Company] growing rapidly. As you open new outlets, how are you ensuring each one maintains the same operational standards from day one?

Most chains figure out waste tracking at outlet #5, then wish they'd started at outlet #1.

We help you get it right from the start. Worth discussing?"
```

---

### Tactic 3: The Scalability Question

```
"As [Company] scales beyond [current #] outlets, what's your biggest concern - maintaining quality, operational consistency, or profitability?

[Listen]

That's exactly the problem we solve for growth-stage chains. 15 minutes to explore solutions?"
```
