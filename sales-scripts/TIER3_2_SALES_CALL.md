[To each attendee]:
[CEO Name], pleasure to meet you.
[COO Name], thanks for joining.
[CFO Name], appreciate your time as well.

We have 30 minutes scheduled. Is everyone still good for that timeframe?"

[Confirm]

```

---

### Establishing Credibility (2 minutes):

```
YOU: "Quick context on WasteWise:

We specialize in enterprise F&B operations - specifically chains with 10+ outlets.

**Our Focus**:
• Waste reduction at scale (40-50% chain-wide)
• Operational standardization (franchise-ready)
• Enterprise integrations (ERP, multi-POS, supply chain)

**Recent Enterprises** (Can Share Under NDA):
• [X]-outlet hotel chain: 44% reduction, RM 180k monthly savings
• [Y]-location QSR franchise: Standardized operations, enabled expansion from [X] to [Y] outlets
• [Z] regional chain: Full ERP integration, board-level reporting

**Why This Matters**: We understand enterprise complexity - not just selling to small restaurants.

Questions on our background before we dive in?"

[Brief, establish credibility, move on]
```

---

## 📋 PART 2: ENTERPRISE DISCOVERY (8-10 Minutes)

### Question 1: Strategic Priorities (To CEO)

```
YOU: "[CEO Name], at the highest level - what are your top 3 strategic priorities for [Company] over the next 12-24 months?"

[Listen carefully - could be]:
- Expand to X locations
- Enter new markets/regions
- Launch franchise program
- Improve profitability/margins
- IPO preparation
- Acquisition strategy

CEO: [Responses]

YOU: "Got it. And if you achieve those, what does [Company] look like in 2 years?"

[Let CEO paint vision]

YOU: "Love that. And what's the biggest operational blocker to achieving that vision?"

[Identify how your solution fits their strategy]
```

---

### Question 2: Operational Challenges (To COO)

```
YOU: "[COO Name], from operations perspective - with [X] outlets across [regions], what's your biggest challenge in maintaining consistency?"

[Listen for]:
- Standardization across locations
- Visibility without being on-site
- Replicating best practices
- New outlet ramp-up time
- Manager turnover impact
- System fragmentation

COO: [Response]

YOU: "And how does that impact your ability to support [CEO]'s strategic priorities around [what CEO said]?"

[Connect operations challenges to strategic goals]
```

---

### Question 3: Financial Impact (To CFO)

```
YOU: "[CFO Name], from a financial perspective - what's your current chain-wide food cost percentage?"

CFO: [Response - likely 30-40%]

YOU: "And do you have visibility into variance across locations? For example, does outlet #1 run at 30% while outlet #10 runs at 40%?"

[Usually they don't have this granularity]

YOU: "That variance - even 5% across [X] outlets - is RM [calculate]k monthly.

If we could:
1. Identify which outlets are most/least efficient
2. Replicate best practices from best to worst
3. Bring all outlets toward top-quartile performance

What would that do for EBITDA margins?"

CFO: [Should be positive response - it's their job to care about margins]
```

---

### Question 4: Current Tech Landscape (To COO/CIO if present)

```
YOU: "What enterprise systems do you currently use?

• ERP system?
• POS systems (same across all outlets)?
• Supply chain management?
• Business intelligence/reporting?

[Listen, take notes]

YOU: "And how well do those systems talk to each other? Full integration or siloed?"

[Usually siloed]

YOU: "That's the challenge we solve at enterprise level - we integrate with all of those and provide unified visibility."
```

---

## 🎁 PART 3: ENTERPRISE SOLUTION PRESENTATION (10-12 Minutes)

### Phase A: Problem Restatement (2 minutes)

```
YOU: "Let me make sure I understand the enterprise challenge:

**Strategic Level** ([CEO]):
• Goal: [their strategic priority - expansion/franchise/profitability]
• Blocker: [operational challenge preventing this]

**Operations Level** ([COO]):
• Challenge: [standardization/visibility/consistency]
• Impact: [can't scale efficiently]

**Financial Level** ([CFO]):
• Current State: [X]% average food cost, varies by location
• Opportunity: 5-10% margin improvement = RM [calculate]k monthly

**Bottom Line**:
You need enterprise-grade operational standardization to achieve your strategic goals.

Did I capture that correctly?"

[Get confirmation from all stakeholders]
```

---

### Phase B: Enterprise Platform Overview (3 minutes)

```
YOU: "Here's how WasteWise Enterprise solves this:

**Unlike our SME packages**, Enterprise includes:

**1. FULL PLATFORM**:
• All 5 core solutions (AI, Waste, Inventory, Supplier, Compliance)
• Enterprise dashboard (board-level reporting)
• Unlimited outlets/locations
• Multi-region support

**2. CUSTOM INTEGRATIONS**:
• Your ERP (SAP, Oracle, whatever you use)
• All POS systems (even if different per outlet)
• Supply chain systems
• Financial reporting
• Real-time P&L impact visibility

**3. DEDICATED ACCOUNT TEAM**:
• Account Director (full-time, yours)
• Technical Account Manager
• Implementation team (for [X]-outlet rollout)
• Customer Success Manager
• Direct executive sponsor access

**4. ENTERPRISE FEATURES**:
• White-label (your brand, if franchising)
• Custom development (your specific needs)
• SSO and advanced security
• Multi-currency (if regional expansion)
• Franchise fee automation (if applicable)

**RESULT**:
• 40-50% waste reduction across ALL outlets
• RM 100-300k+ monthly savings (depending on scale)
• 8% EBITDA margin improvement
• Franchise-ready operations
• Scalability to 100+ outlets

Does this align with what [Company] needs?"
```

---

### Phase C: Enterprise ROI (3 minutes)

```
YOU: "[CFO Name], let me walk through the enterprise economics:

**Current State** ([Company]):
• [X] outlets × RM [avg revenue] = RM [total]/month
• Food cost: ~[Y]% = RM [calculate] monthly food spend
• Enterprise waste: 10-15% = RM [calculate] monthly waste
• **Annual waste**: RM [monthly × 12]

**Variance Opportunity**:
• Best outlet: ~[Z]% food cost
• Worst outlet: ~[Z+10]% food cost
• **Bringing all to best-performer level**: RM [calculate] monthly

**With WasteWise Enterprise**:
• Waste reduced: 40-50%
• Variance reduced: Outlets within 2% of each other
• Operational efficiency: RM 100-300k monthly savings
• Margin improvement: 8-10% EBITDA

**Investment**:
• Enterprise Platform: RM [15-50k+]/month (custom pricing)
• Implementation: RM [X] one-time
• **Total Year 1**: RM [calculate]

**Return**:
• Monthly savings: RM 100-300k
• **Annual savings**: RM 1.2M-3.6M
• Less investment: RM [Y]
• **Net Year 1**: RM 1.0M-3.4M+

**ROI**: 5-15x in Year 1 alone

[Pause for reaction]

That's board-level impact. Thoughts?"
```

---

## 🏢 PART 4: PILOT/POC PROPOSAL (5 Minutes)

### Enterprise Pilot Structure:

```
YOU: "Given [Company]'s scale and sophistication, I recommend a structured Proof-of-Concept:

**POC STRUCTURE**:

**Phase 1** (Month 1-2): Planning + Pilot
• Scope: 3-5 pilot outlets
• Full Enterprise platform deployment
• Integration with your existing systems
• Stakeholder interviews and requirements gathering

**Phase 2** (Month 3-4): Validation
• Measure waste reduction (target: 40%+)
• Calculate ROI (RM 100k+ monthly)
• Assess enterprise integration success
• Staff adoption across pilot locations
• Refine for enterprise-wide rollout

**Phase 3** (Month 5-9): Enterprise Rollout
• Phased implementation across remaining [X] outlets
• Region-by-region or cluster approach
• Full change management support
• All outlets operational by day 180

**PILOT INVESTMENT**:
• Fixed fee: RM 50,000-100,000 (pilot only)
• No monthly commitment during pilot
• If successful, enterprise pricing: RM [X]/month

**SUCCESS CRITERIA**:
• 40%+ waste reduction at pilot locations
• RM 100k+ monthly savings demonstrated
• Successful ERP integration
• 90%+ staff adoption
• Board approval for full rollout

**GUARANTEE**:
• If pilot doesn't hit success criteria, you owe nothing beyond pilot fee
• If it succeeds, we earn right to enterprise-wide deployment

Make sense as an approach?"
```

---

## 🚧 PART 5: ENTERPRISE OBJECTION HANDLING (5-7 Minutes)

### Objection 1: "We have internal IT team building this"

**Response**:
```
YOU: "That's great you have internal capability!

Question: What's your IT team's timeline to build, and do they have F&B domain expertise?

[Listen]

YOU: "Here's what we typically see:

**Build Internally**:
• Timeline: 12-24 months
• Cost: RM 500k-2M (fully loaded with salaries)
• Risk: Might not work, needs F&B expertise
• Opportunity cost: 18 months × RM 100-200k monthly = RM 1.8-3.6M lost

**Buy from Us**:
• Timeline: 6-9 months to full deployment
• Cost: RM 180-600k annually  
• Risk: Minimal (POC proves it works)
• Opportunity: Start saving RM 100-300k monthly in 6 months

Plus, your IT team can focus on YOUR differentiating technology, not commodity operations software.

Does build vs buy analysis change with those numbers?"
```

---

### Objection 2: "We're in RFP process with other vendors"

**Response**:
```
YOU: "Perfect! Competitive process is smart.

Happy to participate in your RFP. Can you share:
• RFP timeline?
• Key evaluation criteria?
• Other vendors being considered?
• Decision makers and process?

[Listen, take notes]

YOU: "Great. I'm confident we'll compare favorably on:
1. **F&B Specialization**: We only do F&B (not generic software)
2. **Enterprise Integration**: Full ERP/multi-POS capability
3. **Proven Results**: 40-50% reduction at enterprise scale
4. **Guarantee**: 8% margin improvement or work for free
5. **Dedicated Team**: Full-time account team, not shared resources

We'll submit a strong RFP response.

In the meantime, would a pilot POC alongside RFP evaluation be valuable? Proves our claims while you evaluate others?"
```

---

### Objection 3: "Investment is significant for enterprise"

**Response**:
```
YOU: "[CFO Name], you're right - RM [X]/month is significant.

But let's look at enterprise ROI differently:

**Per-Outlet Economics**:
• [X] outlets = RM [price/X] per outlet
• Savings: RM 100-300k monthly / [X] outlets = RM [Y] per outlet
• Net: RM [savings - cost] per outlet monthly

**Cost as % of Revenue**:
• Your revenue: RM [total]/month
• Our cost: RM [price]/month  
• **% of revenue: [calculate - should be <1%]**

You're spending <1% of revenue to improve margins by 8-10%.

**Payback Period**: 1-2 months (or negative - cash positive from day 1)

**5-Year NPV**: RM [calculate 5-year value]

From enterprise finance perspective, this is one of the highest-ROI investments you can make.

Agree?"
```

---

## 💼 PART 6: PILOT/POC CLOSE (5 Minutes)

### The Enterprise Pilot Proposal:

```
YOU: "Based on our discussion, here's what I recommend:

**ENTERPRISE PROOF-OF-CONCEPT PROGRAM**

**Scope**: 3-5 outlets (we help you select)
• 1 high-performer (prove it works for your best)
• 1-2 average performers (show typical results)
• 1 low-performer (dramatic improvement potential)

**Duration**: 90-120 days
• Month 1-2: Implementation + integration
• Month 3-4: Results validation

**Investment**:
• POC Fixed Fee: RM 75,000-150,000
• Covers: Full implementation, integration, training, support
• No monthly recurring during POC

**Success Criteria** (You Define These):
• Minimum waste reduction: 35-40%
• Minimum savings: RM 100k+ monthly
• Integration success: Works with your ERP
• Staff adoption: 85%+ usage
• Board satisfaction: Recommended for full rollout

**If POC Succeeds**:
• Enterprise pricing: RM [X]/month (customized to your scale)
• Full deployment across all [Y] outlets
• Guaranteed 8% margin improvement or we work for free

**If POC Fails**:
• You've spent RM 75-150k
• But you know definitively whether this works for [Company]
• No ongoing commitment

**Your ROI on POC**:
• Even if you only deploy at the 3-5 pilot outlets permanently: RM [calculate] monthly savings
• POC pays for itself in 2-3 months from pilot outlets alone
• If you roll out enterprise-wide: RM 1-3M+ annual impact

Thoughts on this approach?"
```

---

## 🎯 ENTERPRISE CLOSING TECHNIQUES

### Technique 1: The Board Perspective

```
YOU: "[CEO Name], if you present this to your board, what would they want to see?

[Listen]

YOU: "So they'd want: [repeat their criteria]

Our POC is designed to give you exactly that evidence.

90 days, defined success criteria, measurable ROI.

If it works, you have board-ready proof to roll out enterprise-wide.

If it doesn't, you've done due diligence and can move on.

Shall we structure the POC to give you what the board needs?"
```

---

### Technique 2: The Strategic Alignment

```
YOU: "Let me connect the dots between our platform and your strategy:

**Your Goal**: [Expand to X outlets / Launch franchise / Improve margins]

**How We Enable That**:
• [Specific connection to waste reduction]
• [Specific connection to operational standardization]
• [Specific connection to scalability]

**Result**: You achieve [strategic goal] faster/better/cheaper with waste management as foundation.

Does that strategic alignment resonate?"
```

---

### Technique 3: The Competitive Intelligence

```
YOU: "I'm going to share something you might find valuable:

Your main competitors - [Competitor 1], [Competitor 2] - here's what we know about their operations:

[Share non-confidential industry intelligence]

You have an opportunity to leapfrog them operationally.

While they're running at [X]% food cost, you could be at [X-8]%.

That's sustainable competitive advantage.

Worth the POC to validate?"
```

---

```

---

### Path B: Formal RFP Required

```
YOU: "Understood - formal procurement process makes sense at your scale.

What's your RFP timeline and process?

[Listen]

YOU: "Perfect. A few questions to ensure our RFP response is competitive:

1. Key evaluation criteria (weighted if possible)?
2. Budget range allocated?
3. Required implementation timeline?
4. Integration requirements (must-haves)?
5. Reference requirements?
6. Decision timeline?

[Get answers]

YOU: "Great! We'll submit a strong RFP response by [deadline].

In parallel, would you be open to a technical review with our integration team? Ensures our RFP response addresses your specific technical environment."

[Try to maintain engagement during RFP period]
```

---

### Path C: Need Internal Approval

```
YOU: "Completely understand. What's your internal approval process?

[Listen]

YOU: "And how can I support that process?

• Materials for [who needs to approve]?
• Presentation to [committee]?
• Technical review with [IT team]?
• Financial analysis for [CFO/Board]?

My goal is to make your internal approval process as easy as possible.

What would be most helpful?"
