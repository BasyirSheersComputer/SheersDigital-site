# Tier 3 (Enterprise) - Follow-Up Scripts
## Enterprise Procurement Process → POC/Contract Approval

**Target ICP**: Large chains (10+ outlets)  
**Decision Process**: Committee-based, formal procurement  
**Timeline**: 2-6 months typical  
**Goal**: Navigate corporate process, get POC approved

---

## 🎯 ENTERPRISE FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY

**Fundamental Differences**:
- **Formal process** (RFP, legal review, procurement)
- **Multiple stakeholders** (CEO, COO, CFO, Legal, IT, Procurement, Board)
- **Longer timeline** (2-6 months vs 1-4 weeks for Tier 1/2)
- **Higher touch** (bi-weekly vs weekly)
- **More professional** (no casual WhatsApp, formal communication)

**Success Metrics**:
- 40-60% advance to POC from executive briefing
- 60-80% convert to full contract after successful POC
- Overall: 25-50% close rate (lower than Tier 1/2, but 5-20x higher value)

---

## 📧 FOLLOW-UP #2: 1 WEEK (Professional Check-In)

```
Subject: RE: [Company] - Enterprise POC Proposal

Dear [CEO/COO/CFO Names],

Hope you've had a productive week!

Following up on the Enterprise POC proposal sent last [day].

**Quick Questions**:
• Have you and your team had a chance to review?
• Any initial questions I can address?
• Would a follow-up call with specific stakeholders be helpful?

**Additional Resources** (If Valuable):
• Technical deep-dive with our CTO (for your IT team)
• Financial model walkthrough (for your CFO/finance team)
• Reference calls with current enterprise clients
• On-site visit to see our operations

**Timeline**: 
Understanding enterprise decisions take time. Just want to ensure you have everything needed to move forward when timing is right.

When would be appropriate for a follow-up discussion?

Best regards,

Basyir Abdul Rahman
+60 11-6326 3808

## 📞 FOLLOW-UP #3: 2 WEEKS (Scheduled Review Call)

### Call Structure (30-45 minutes):

```
YOU: "Good [morning/afternoon] everyone. Thanks for making time for this review call.

[To each attendee]:
[Names], good to have you all here.

Quick agenda:
1. Answer any questions on the POC proposal (15 min)
2. Discuss your internal decision process and timeline (10 min)
3. Align on next steps (10 min)

Sound good?"

[Proceed]

YOU: "Let's start with questions. What's come up in your review?"

[LISTEN. Answer thoroughly. Address each stakeholder's concerns specifically.]
```

---

### Addressing Different Stakeholder Concerns:

**CEO Questions** (Usually Strategic):
```
CEO: "How does this support our franchise expansion?"

YOU: "Excellent question. Here's the direct connection:

Franchisees need three things:
1. Proven profitability model (waste reduction improves unit economics)
2. Standardized operations (our system is same everywhere)
3. Support infrastructure (we train their teams)

Our white-label capability means franchisees use [Company]-branded system, not third-party.

This becomes a competitive advantage in franchise sales - 'Here's your proven ops playbook.'

Make sense?"
```

**CFO Questions** (Always Financial):
```
CFO: "What's the payback period?"

YOU: "Great question. Let's calculate for [Company] specifically:

**POC Investment**: RM 100k (fixed)
**POC Savings** (5 outlets × RM 20k each × 3 months): RM 300k
**POC Net**: +RM 200k

So POC pays for itself AND generates RM 200k profit.

**Enterprise Rollout**:
• Monthly Investment: RM [X]
• Monthly Savings: RM 100-300k
• Net Monthly: +RM [calculate]
• **Payback: Negative (cash positive from month 1)**

**5-Year NPV**: RM [calculate] at [discount rate]%

From CFO perspective, this is a CapEx-light, high-ROI operational improvement.

Agree?"
```

**COO/Operations Questions** (Implementation):
```
COO: "How disruptive is implementation across [X] outlets?"

YOU: "Minimal disruption. Here's our phased approach:

• Week 1-2: No disruption (planning phase)
• Week 3-4: Pilot locations (2-3 outlets) - 4 hours total staff time
• Week 5-16: Rollout (2-3 outlets/week) - 4 hours per outlet
• Total: ~4 hours per outlet over 3 months

We handle:
• Setup (95% of work)
• Integration (IT-side heavy lifting)
• Training (concise, practical)

You handle:
• Staff attendance at training
• Adoption monitoring
• Process adjustments

Your operations team involvement: ~2-3 hours/week total.

Manageable?"
```

## 🏢 FOLLOW-UP #4: 4 WEEKS (Maintain Momentum)

### Email to Champion:

```
Subject: [Company] POC - Supporting Your Internal Process

Hi [Champion - likely COO or CEO],

Wanted to check in on the POC approval process.

**Understanding enterprise decisions take time**, just want to ensure you have everything needed when [approval meeting/board review/budget committee] happens.

**Can I Support With**:
• Board presentation deck (if you're presenting to board)
• Financial analysis (deeper CFO-level modeling)
• Technical documentation (for IT review)
• Reference calls (similar enterprises)
• Competitive analysis (vs build-internal or other vendors)

**Timeline Question**:
What's realistic timeline for POC decision - end of this quarter, next quarter, or dependent on specific milestones?

Just want to align resources appropriately.

Happy to jump on a quick call if easier to discuss than email.

Best regards,

• What stage: [Initial review / Stakeholder alignment / Legal / Procurement / Budget approval / Board approval]?

## 🎯 FOLLOW-UP #6: 8 WEEKS (Decision Forcing - Polite)

```
Subject: [Company] - POC Decision Status

Dear [CEO Name],

It's been 2 months since our executive briefing regarding enterprise waste reduction for [Company].

I haven't received an update on your POC decision, so I'm reaching out for clarity.

**Three Possibilities**:
1. **Still in process** - Just need more time
2. **Decided against** - Not the right fit or timing
3. **Moved forward elsewhere** - Chose different solution

All are completely fine! I just need to know so I can plan accordingly.

**If Still in Process**:
• What's your timeline for decision?
• What do you need from me to support approval?
• Shall I follow up in [X weeks/months]?

**If Decided Against**:
• Can you share why, for my learning?
• Is there a future time to reconnect (6-12 months)?

**If Moved Forward Elsewhere**:
• Hope it works well for you!
• If it doesn't deliver expected results, I'm here

**One Way or Another**:
I'd like clarity so we both can move forward appropriately.

Can you let me know status by Friday?

Best regards,

Basyir Abdul Rahman
+60 11-6326 3808

P.S. Regardless of outcome, happy to share our latest Malaysian F&B operational benchmarking data with you. No strings attached - just valuable industry intelligence.

## 💼 MULTI-STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT

### Keep ALL Stakeholders Engaged:

**To CEO** (Strategic Updates):
```
[CEO Name],

Quick update on POC approval process:

Your team has been great to work with. [COO] and [CFO] are aligned on ROI and implementation.

From what I understand, waiting on [specific approval/review/process].

Timeline-wise, still tracking toward [quarter/month] POC start?

Happy to provide any additional support for [board meeting/approval process/etc].

Best regards,
Basyir
```

**To COO** (Implementation Planning):
```
[COO Name],

While we wait for POC approval, wanted to start preliminary implementation planning.

If/when approved, which 3-5 outlets would you recommend for POC?

Criteria to consider:
• Geographic diversity (different regions)
• Performance diversity (high, average, low performers)
• Manager engagement (who'd be best pilot participants)
• Technical feasibility (integration complexity)

Happy to discuss implementation strategy when you have 15 minutes.

Best regards,
Basyir
```

**To CFO** (Financial Modeling):
```
[CFO Name],

Quick follow-up on the financial model.

I've updated the ROI calculator with [Company]'s specific numbers:
• [X] outlets
• RM [Y] revenue
• [Z]% food cost

Updated projections: RM 1.5-4M annual savings (conservative scenario).

Attached: Updated financial model with sensitivity analysis.

Let me know if you'd like to review together or if your finance team has questions.

Best regards,
Basyir
```

## 🚧 ENTERPRISE-SPECIFIC OBJECTION HANDLING

### Objection: "We have a long vendor evaluation process"

```
"Completely understand - enterprise vendor selection should be thorough.

Can I ask: What does your evaluation process typically look like?

[Listen]

Got it. Here's how we can support that:

• **RFP Response**: Comprehensive, on-time
• **Technical Review**: Our CTO available for deep-dive
• **Security Audit**: Full documentation + 3rd party certifications
• **References**: 3+ enterprise clients, happy to provide contacts
• **POC**: Proves claims before full commitment

**Accelerator**: Can we start POC while you complete vendor evaluation?

Gives you hands-on validation alongside paperwork review. Often shortens decision timeline.

Interested in parallel approach?"
```

---

### Objection: "Budget is allocated for next fiscal year"

```
"Understood - enterprise budget cycles are important.

Quick question: What's your fiscal year timing?

[Listen]

So POC decision by [quarter], implementation by [quarter]?

Here's what I suggest:

**Option A**: Reserve POC slot now for next FY start (no commitment, just planning)

**Option B**: Start POC this quarter on trial basis (RM X), full deployment next FY when budget allocated

**Option C**: Pilot at 2-3 outlets this FY (fits current budget?), full rollout next FY

**Why This Matters**:
Each quarter of delay = RM 300-900k in lost savings.

If budget isn't available until Q[X], that's RM [calculate] opportunity cost.

Worth finding a way to start sooner, even if limited scope?"
```

## 📈 ENTERPRISE CLOSE TACTICS

### Tactic 1: The Board Timeline Alignment

```
"[CEO], when's your next board meeting?

[Listen]

If we approve POC by [date], we can have results ready for [board meeting + 90 days].

That gives board concrete evidence to approve full deployment.

Otherwise, delays another quarter.

Worth fast-tracking internal approval to hit that board timeline?"
```

---

### Tactic 2: The Competitive Pressure

```
"Sharing in confidence: [Competitor Chain] is evaluating similar enterprise waste management.

If they implement first, they'll have operational advantage.

Not trying to create false urgency, but competitive dynamics matter at your level.

Worth moving forward with POC to maintain competitive position?"
```

---

### Tactic 3: The Fiscal Year End

```
"I know you're approaching end of FY[X].

Quick thought: If you approve POC before fiscal year end, you can:
• Use current year's budget (if available)
• Show board you're investing in operational excellence
• Have results by Q2 next year (proves ROI)

vs. waiting until FY[X+1]:
• Delays results by 6+ months
• RM 600k-1.8M in lost savings during that delay

Worth finalizing POC before year-end?"
```
