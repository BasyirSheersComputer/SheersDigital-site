---

## 📞 PART 1: OPENING (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Warm Greeting & Agenda Setting (30 seconds)

```
YOU: "Hi [Owner Name]! It's Basyir from WasteWise. Thanks for making time for this quick call!

Just to confirm - we have about 10 minutes, right?"

THEM: "Yes"

YOU: "Perfect! Here's what I'd like to cover:
1. Understand your current situation (3 minutes)
2. Share what we do and how it might help (4 minutes)
3. See if it makes sense to move forward (3 minutes)

Sound good?"
```

**Why This Works**:
- Sets clear expectations
- Shows respect for their time
- Gives you control of conversation
- Low pressure

---

### Step 2: Permission & Transition (30 seconds)

```
YOU: "Before I explain what we do, I need to understand your specific situation first. 

Cool if I ask you a few quick questions about [Restaurant Name]?"

THEM: "Sure"

YOU: "Great! Let's dive in."
```

---

## 📋 PART 2: DISCOVERY & QUALIFICATION (3-4 Minutes)

### Phase A: Understand the Business (60 seconds)

**Question 1: Confirm Size**
```
YOU: "First, just to confirm - you operate [X] location(s), correct? Just the one, or do you have multiple?"

THEM: [Response]

YOU: [Take note] "Got it. And roughly how long have you been operating [Restaurant Name]?"
```

**Goal**: Confirm ICP tier fit (1-3 outlets = Tier 1)

---

**Question 2: Revenue/Scale**
```
YOU: "And without getting into specific numbers, roughly what monthly revenue range are you in - under RM 100k, RM 100-200k, or above RM 200k?"

THEM: [Response]

YOU: "Perfect, that helps me understand your scale."
```

**Goal**: Confirm Tier 1 fit (RM 50-200k)  
**Red Flag**: If >RM 200k, might need Tier 2 (note for later)

---

### Phase B: Current State & Pain Points (90 seconds)

**Question 3: Current Waste Tracking**
```
YOU: "Quick question: Are you currently tracking food waste - where it's happening, how much, why?"

THEM: [Responses vary - handle below]

[If "No"]:
YOU: "That's very common. Most restaurants don't track it systematically. 

Quick follow-up: Do you have a sense of what your food cost percentage is running?"

[If "Yes, manually"]:
YOU: "Great that you're tracking it! What method are you using - Excel, notebook, or something else?"

[Then]: "And are you happy with that system, or is there room for improvement?"

[If "Yes, with software"]:
YOU: "Oh interesting! What are you using?"

[Listen, then]: "And how's that working for you? Getting the results you hoped for?"
```

**Listen carefully here!** This reveals:
- Awareness level (do they know the problem?)
- Current solutions (competitor intel)
- Satisfaction level (switching opportunity)
- Sophistication (will they value your solution?)

---

**Question 4: Food Cost % (CRITICAL)**
```
YOU: "What's your current food cost percentage - roughly?"

THEM: [Response]

[If "Don't know"]:
YOU: "No worries, many don't track it precisely. Industry average for [type] restaurants is 32-38%. 

If you're above that, there's usually 5-10 percentage points you can save."

[If "30-35%"]:
YOU: "That's good! Industry average is 32-38%, so you're doing better than most. 

Still, there's usually room to get that even lower - every percentage point is pure profit."

[If "Above 38%"]:
YOU: "Okay, that's higher than ideal. Industry average is 32-38%, so there's definitely opportunity there.

That difference - even 5% - could be RM [calculate: revenue × 0.05] monthly. That's significant."
```

**Why This Matters**:
- Validates the problem
- Quantifies the opportunity
- Creates urgency (they're losing money)

---

**Question 5: Biggest Pain Point (Open-Ended)**
```
YOU: "What's your biggest operational challenge right now - the thing keeping you up at night?"

[LISTEN. DON'T INTERRUPT. TAKE NOTES.]

THEM: [Could be]:
- "Food costs keep rising"
- "Quality inconsistency"
- "Staff turnover / theft"
- "Want to expand but not sure if ready"
- "Profitability / margins"
- "Inventory management"

YOU: "Got it. And if you could wave a magic wand and fix that, what would change for [Restaurant Name]?"
```

**This is GOLD**: 
- Reveals their dream outcome
- Shows what they value most
- Gives you their exact language (use it back)
- Tells you how to position your solution

---

### Phase C: Dream Outcome (60 seconds)

**Question 6: Ideal Future State**
```
YOU: "Let me ask this: 60 days from now, what would success look like for [Restaurant Name]?

If we solve [their pain point], what else improves?"

[LISTEN. Let them paint the picture]

THEM: [Might say]:
- "Better margins"
- "Less stress"
- "Ready to expand"
- "More control"
- "Better quality"

YOU: "Love that. So [repeat back their outcome] is the goal, right?"

THEM: "Exactly"

YOU: "Got it. So if I could show you how to achieve that within 60 days, with zero risk, would that be valuable?"

[Should be YES - if not, they're not qualified]
```

---

## 🎯 PART 3: PRESENT SOLUTION (4-5 Minutes)

### Phase A: Diagnostic Summary (30 seconds)

```
YOU: "Okay, let me summarize what I'm hearing:

1. You're running [X] outlet(s) doing roughly RM [Y] monthly
2. Food cost is around [Z]% (industry average is 32-38%)
3. Biggest challenge is [their pain point]
4. Ideal outcome is [their dream outcome]

Did I get that right?"

THEM: "Yes"

YOU: "Perfect. Let me show you how we help restaurants exactly like yours achieve that."
```

**Why This Works**:
- Confirms you listened
- Shows you understand their situation
- Creates smooth transition to pitch
- Gets their agreement (micro-yes)

---

### Phase B: Solution Introduction (60 seconds)

```
YOU: "So here's what we do:

Our Quick Win system helps single-location restaurants like [Restaurant Name] reduce food waste by 20-30% within 60 days, which translates to RM 15-25k in monthly savings.

Here's how it works:

**Step 1**: We set up a simple waste tracking system (takes your staff 30 seconds per day - that's it)

**Step 2**: You immediately see where waste is happening - spoilage, overproduction, theft, portions

**Step 3**: We help you plug those leaks one by one

Result: Within 60 days, you're typically saving RM 15-25k monthly.

Does that make sense so far?"

[Pause for confirmation]
```

**Keep It Simple**:
- Focus on OUTCOME (save RM 15-25k)
- Not features (AI, cloud, etc.)
- Use their timeline (60 days)
- Use specific numbers

---

### Phase C: Package Details (90 seconds)

```
YOU: "The Quick Win package includes:

**What You Get**:
✓ Choose ONE solution based on your biggest need:
  - Option 1: Waste Logging (if you don't know where waste is)
  - Option 2: Inventory Integration (if you have spoilage issues)
  - Option 3: Compliance Automation (if regulations are a headache)

✓ Complete setup and staff training (we handle everything)
✓ Ongoing support via WhatsApp and email
✓ Monthly performance reports showing your savings

**How Long**: Up and running in 21-30 days

**Investment**: RM 2,997 per month

**Guarantee**: If you don't save at least RM 15k in the first 60 days, we refund you completely. And you can cancel after 90 days - no long-term contract.

So it's completely risk-free.

Based on what you told me about [their pain point], I'd recommend [Solution Option]. Make sense?"
```

---

**Question for Engagement**:
```
YOU: "Between reducing waste, better inventory control, or compliance automation - which resonates most with what you need at [Restaurant Name]?"

[Listen to their choice]

YOU: "Perfect! So [their choice] would directly help with [their pain point they mentioned]. Here's specifically how..."

[Tailor explanation to their choice]
```

---

### Phase D: ROI Calculation (60 seconds)

```
YOU: "Let me show you the math on this:

**Current State** (Your Numbers):
- Monthly revenue: ~RM [their revenue]
- Food cost %: ~[their %] 
- Food spend: ~RM [revenue × food %] per month
- Typical waste: 10-15% of food cost
- **Your monthly waste**: ~RM [calculate] 

**With WasteWise** (Conservative 25% reduction):
- Waste reduced by: 25%
- Monthly savings: RM [waste × 0.25]
- Investment: RM 2,997
- **NET SAVINGS**: RM [savings - 2,997] monthly

That's [calculate ROI] times ROI. Every month.

Does that math make sense for [Restaurant Name]?"
```

**Example Calculation**:
- Revenue: RM 150k
- Food cost: 38% = RM 57k
- Waste: 12% = RM 6,840
- 25% reduction = RM 1,710 saved
- Cost: RM 2,997
- **Wait, that's negative!** 

**Correction**: Use the RM 15-25k savings figure (industry average across all waste sources)

```
YOU: "Let me put it differently:

Industry data shows single-location restaurants typically lose RM 15-25k monthly to all forms of waste - not just food spoilage, but overproduction, theft, portion inconsistency, supplier issues.

With our system tracking everything, clients reduce that by 20-30%.

Conservative estimate for your size: **Save RM 15k monthly**
Investment: **RM 2,997**

That's RM 12k net profit improvement every month. RM 144k per year.

And if you don't hit at least RM 15k in savings after 60 days, you get a full refund.

Zero risk, high reward. Make sense?"
```

---

## 🚧 PART 4: HANDLE OBJECTIONS (2-3 Minutes)

### Objection 1: "That sounds expensive"

**Response**:
```
YOU: "I hear you! RM 2,997 per month is an investment.

But let me ask: If I'm understanding correctly, you're currently losing RM 15-25k monthly to waste, right?

So really, it costs you RM 2,997 to save RM 15-25k. That's actually making you RM 12-22k more profitable every month.

Plus, we guarantee it. If you don't save at least RM 15k after 60 days, you get a full refund.

So the real question is: Can you afford NOT to do this? Every month you wait costs you RM 15-25k.

Does that perspective make sense?"
```

---

### Objection 2: "I need to think about it"

**Response**:
```
YOU: "Absolutely! This is a business decision - you should think about it.

Can I ask - what specifically do you need to think about? 

Is it:
- The investment amount?
- Whether it'll actually work?
- Implementation/timing?
- Something else?

[Listen to real concern, address it specifically]

Because I want to make sure you have all the information you need to make a smart decision."

[Address their specific concern, then]:

YOU: "And here's the thing: We have the 30-day money-back guarantee specifically for this.

You don't have to think about 'will it work' - we guarantee it will or you get refunded.

So really, the only decision is: Do you want to stop losing RM 15-25k every month?

If yes, let's get started. If no, I totally understand and we can revisit later.

What do you think?"
```

---

### Objection 3: "We need to talk to my partner/manager first"

**Response**:
```
YOU: "That makes total sense! Big decisions should be made together.

A few options:

**Option 1**: Can we get them on this call right now? I'm happy to wait 2 minutes while you grab them.

**Option 2**: Can we schedule a 15-minute call with both of you - maybe tomorrow or Thursday?

**Option 3**: You discuss it together, and I follow up in 2-3 days.

What works best for you?"

[If they choose Option 3]:

YOU: "Perfect! When you discuss, the key points are:
1. Currently losing RM 15-25k monthly to waste
2. Our system reduces that by 20-30% (RM 15-25k savings)
3. Costs RM 2,997/month - so net RM 12-22k profit increase
4. 30-day money-back guarantee - zero risk
5. Up and running in 30 days

I'll send you a quick summary by WhatsApp you can share.

When should I follow up - Friday or next Monday?"
```

---

### Objection 4: "How do I know this actually works?"

**Response**:
```
YOU: "Great question! Three types of proof:

**1. Industry Data** (Third-Party):
World Resources Institute (2023) study shows restaurants using waste tracking achieve 25-40% reduction. This isn't magic - it's proven methodology.

**2. Our Guarantee** (Risk Reversal):
We guarantee you save at least RM 15k in 60 days or get a full refund. We only make money if you save money. Our success depends on your success.

**3. The Science** (Logic):
You can't improve what you don't measure. Once you track waste, you see patterns. Once you see patterns, you can fix them. It's that simple.

Plus, worst case: You try it for 30 days, don't see results, get your money back. You lose nothing.

Does that address your concern, or is there something specific you're worried about?"
```

---

### Objection 5: "We're already using [Competitor/Excel]"

**Response**:
```
YOU: "That's great that you're already tracking! Means you see the value.

Can I ask - are you hitting your waste reduction targets with [current system]?"

[If YES]:
YOU: "That's impressive! What reduction % have you achieved?
[If <25%]: "Great start! There's usually more to capture. We help clients get to 30-40%."
[If >25%]: "Excellent! You're ahead of most. Might not need us then!"

[If NO or "Not sure"]:
YOU: "That's exactly what we solve. The difference with our system:

1. **Simple**: Staff use it (30 seconds/day vs complex software nobody uses)
2. **Actionable**: Not just data - we tell you what to fix
3. **Guaranteed**: We guarantee RM 15k savings or refund you

Worth trying for 30 days risk-free to see if you can improve on current results?"
```

---

### Objection 6: "Timing is bad right now"

**Response**:
```
YOU: "I totally understand - operations are always hectic!

Can I ask - when would timing be better? 

[Listen, then]:

YOU: "Here's my concern: Every month you wait costs you RM 15-25k in preventable waste.

If timing is 'bad' for the next 3 months, that's RM 45-75k lost.

Our implementation is designed for busy operators - it takes your team literally 30 seconds per day. We handle the heavy lifting.

Plus, with the 30-day guarantee, you can try it even during a busy period. If it's too disruptive, you get refunded.

What if we start small - just the waste tracking piece - and you see results in 30 days with minimal time investment?

Then if you like it, we can expand. Sound reasonable?"
```

---

## 🎁 PART 5: PRESENT SPECIFIC SOLUTION (2 Minutes)

### Based on Their Pain Point:

**If Pain = "High Food Costs" → Recommend Waste Logging**

```
YOU: "Based on what you shared about high food costs, here's what I recommend:

**Waste Logging Solution** - This specifically helps you:

✓ Track every disposal (what, when, why, how much)
✓ Identify patterns (certain items always spoil on Tuesdays?)
✓ Hold staff accountable (reduce theft and portion inconsistency)
✓ Get daily reports (see exactly where money is going)

**What You'll See in 30 Days**:
- Week 1: "Wow, we waste RM 2k weekly on [specific item]"
- Week 2: Adjust ordering, reduce that waste 50%
- Week 3: Staff more careful (they know they're being tracked)
- Week 4: RM 4-8k monthly savings already showing

**What You'll Achieve in 60 Days**:
- 20-30% total waste reduction
- RM 15-25k monthly savings
- Better margins, less stress

Sound like what you need?"
```

---

**If Pain = "Inventory Issues" → Recommend Inventory Integration**

```
YOU: "Based on the inventory challenges you mentioned, here's what I recommend:

**Inventory Integration** - This specifically helps you:

✓ Real-time stock tracking (know exactly what you have)
✓ Spoilage alerts (before items expire, not after)
✓ Auto-reorder points (never run out OR overstock)
✓ FIFO tracking (use oldest stock first)

**What You'll See in 30 Days**:
- Week 1: Full visibility (finally know what's in the kitchen)
- Week 2: Spoilage alerts save RM 1-2k
- Week 3: Reorder automation saves 5 hours weekly
- Week 4: Stockouts reduced 80%

**What You'll Achieve in 60 Days**:
- 10-15% spoilage reduction
- RM 8-12k monthly savings
- Never run out of key items again

Sound like what [Restaurant Name] needs?"
```

---

**If Pain = "Compliance/Regulations" → Recommend Compliance Automation**

```
YOU: "Based on the compliance headaches you mentioned, here's what I recommend:

**Compliance Automation** - This specifically helps you:

✓ Automated checklists (temp logs, cleaning schedules)
✓ Digital record keeping (no more lost paper logs)
✓ Audit-ready reports (generate in 30 seconds)
✓ Regulatory updates (stay compliant automatically)

**What You'll See in 30 Days**:
- Week 1: All compliance digitized
- Week 2: Save 15-20 hours on paperwork
- Week 3: Stress-free health inspection
- Week 4: Full audit trail for any authority

**What You'll Achieve in 60 Days**:
- 95-100% compliance (avoid RM 50-250k fines)
- Save 20-30 hours weekly
- Peace of mind (no more compliance anxiety)

That solve the problem?"
```

---

## 💰 PART 6: CLOSE OR ADVANCE (2 Minutes)

### The Assumptive Close (Best for Hot Prospects):

```
YOU: "So based on everything we discussed:

- [Their pain point] is costing you RM 15-25k monthly
- Our [Solution] can reduce that by 20-30%
- You'll be up and running in 30 days
- 30-day money-back guarantee if you're not satisfied
- Investment is RM 2,997/month

Honestly, this seems like a no-brainer for [Restaurant Name].

Shall we get you started? I can have the team reach out tomorrow to schedule your setup."

[PAUSE. SILENCE. Let them respond.]
```

**If YES**:
```
YOU: "Fantastic! Welcome aboard!

Next steps:
1. I'll send you a quick agreement via WhatsApp
2. Once signed, our team schedules your onboarding
3. You'll be live within 30 days
4. Start seeing savings immediately after

I'll send that over in the next hour. Any questions before we wrap up?"

[Answer questions, thank them, end call]
```

**If Hesitation**:
```
[See objection handling above, then trial close again]
```

---

### The Trial Close (If Warm but Not Ready):

```
YOU: "Does this sound like something that could help [Restaurant Name]?"

THEM: "Yes, but..." [objection]

[Handle objection, then]:

YOU: "Okay, so if [objection resolved], you'd want to move forward?

[If yes]: [Resolve objection, close]

[If still hesitant]: "What would you need to see or know to feel comfortable moving forward?"

[Listen, address, trial close again]
```

---

### The Alternative Close (If They Need More):

```
YOU: "I sense you're interested but not quite ready to commit. Totally fair!

Here's what I suggest:

**Option 1**: Let's do a 7-day trial. You see the system, your team tests it, you decide. Worth trying?

**Option 2**: I send you a detailed proposal with everything we discussed, you review it, we talk again Friday. Sound good?

**Option 3**: We start with just the waste audit (FREE), you see the RM impact, then decide on the full system. Interested?

Which option feels right?"

[They pick one, schedule next steps]
```

---

## 🔄 PART 7: NEXT STEPS & COMMITMENTS

[Reason]: You're [too small/too big/already have solution/different priority]

Here's what I'd suggest instead: [Alternative recommendation - could be different tier, different timing, or different solution entirely]

But I don't want to waste your time or mine if we're not a good fit. Does that make sense?"

THEM: "Yes, thanks for being honest"

YOU: "Of course! If anything changes - you expand, current system doesn't work out, or waste becomes a bigger priority - feel free to reach out.

Best of luck with [Restaurant Name]!"

[Mark as "Not Qualified" in CRM, move on]

## 💬 SAMPLE FULL CALL TRANSCRIPT

### The Ideal Call Flow:

```
[Call starts - Owner answers]

YOU: "Hi [Owner]! It's Basyir from WasteWise. Thanks for making time!"

THEM: "No problem"

YOU: "We have about 10 minutes, right? Perfect.

Quick agenda: I want to understand your current situation, see if we can help, and if it makes sense, discuss next steps. Sound good?"

THEM: "Sure"

YOU: "Great! So you operate just the one location, correct?"

THEM: "Yes, one restaurant in Bangsar"

YOU: "Got it. And roughly what monthly revenue - under 100k, 100-200k, or above?"

THEM: "Around 120-150k"

YOU: "Perfect, that helps. Now, are you currently tracking food waste systematically?"

THEM: "Not really, just estimate at end of week"

YOU: "Okay, and do you know what your food cost percentage is running?"

THEM: "I think around 38-40%"

YOU: "Okay, that's a bit above industry average of 32-38%. And what's your biggest operational challenge right now?"

THEM: "Honestly, costs keep rising but I can't raise prices. Margins are getting squeezed."

YOU: "I hear that a lot. If you could improve profit margins by 10-15% without raising prices, what would that mean for you?"

THEM: "That would be huge! I could actually breathe easier, maybe finally hire that extra kitchen staff I need."

YOU: "Love that. So better margins leading to ability to invest back in the team - that's the goal?"

THEM: "Exactly"

YOU: "Perfect! Let me show you how we help restaurants exactly like yours achieve that.

[Proceeds to solution presentation - see Phase B above]

...

Based on your RM 120-150k monthly revenue with 38-40% food cost, you're spending about RM 50k on food monthly.

Industry data shows you're likely losing RM 18-22k of that to various forms of waste.

Our Waste Logging system would help you reduce that by 20-30%, saving you roughly RM 4-6k monthly from waste reduction alone.

Plus better portion control, less spoilage, reduced theft - you'd likely hit the RM 15-18k savings range.

Investment is RM 2,997/month, so you're net RM 12-15k more profitable every month.

And that's the margin improvement you need to hire that extra staff, right?"

THEM: "Yeah, that would definitely help"

YOU: "And we guarantee it - if you don't save at least RM 15k in 60 days, full refund. Zero risk.

Honestly, this sounds perfect for what you need at [Restaurant].

Should we get you started?"

THEM: "Um, I think so... but I need to discuss with my wife first, she handles finances"

YOU: "Totally understand! Can we get her on the call now, or schedule 15 minutes when you're both available?"

THEM: "She's not here. Can you send me the details to show her?"

YOU: "Absolutely. I'll send you:
1. Full proposal with ROI calculation
2. Agreement (ready to sign when you're ready)
3. Case study from similar restaurant

When you've discussed, when should I follow up - Friday or Monday?"

THEM: "Friday is better"

YOU: "Perfect! I'll call you Friday at 2pm. In the meantime, key points to discuss:
- Currently losing ~RM 18-22k monthly to waste
- Our system saves RM 15-18k (conservative)
- Costs RM 2,997 - so RM 12-15k net improvement
- 30-day guarantee - zero risk

I'll send that summary now. Any questions before we wrap?"

THEM: "No, that's clear"

YOU: "Great! Talk to you Friday at 2pm. Thanks [Owner]!"
