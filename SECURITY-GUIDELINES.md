# Security Guidelines

## ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL: API Key Security**

### **What Happened**
- Supabase service role key was accidentally committed to the repository
- Google API keys were found in previous commits
- These keys have been removed for security

### **Immediate Actions Taken**
- âœ… Removed Supabase service role key from .env
- âœ… Verified .env is in .gitignore
- âœ… Updated admin scripts with security warnings
- âœ… Created environment template file

### **Security Best Practices**

#### **1. Environment Variables**
- âœ… **NEVER commit API keys** to version control
- âœ… **Use .env files** for local development
- âœ… **Use environment variables** in production
- âœ… **Keep .env in .gitignore**

#### **2. API Key Management**
- ðŸ”’ **Service Role Keys**: Only use temporarily for admin operations
- ðŸ”’ **Anon Keys**: Safe for client-side use
- ðŸ”’ **Firebase Keys**: Use environment variables only

#### **3. Development Workflow**
```bash
# For admin operations (temporarily)
echo "VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_key_here" >> .env
npm run test-admin
# Remove the key immediately after use
```

#### **4. Production Deployment**
- Use environment variables in your hosting platform
- Never hardcode keys in source code
- Rotate keys regularly

### **Current Status**
- âœ… **All forms working** with anonymous access
- âœ… **No hardcoded keys** in source code
- âœ… **Environment variables** properly configured
- âœ… **Security leaks** resolved

### **Next Steps**
1. **Rotate all exposed keys** in Supabase and Firebase dashboards
2. **Monitor for unauthorized access**
3. **Use environment variables** in production
4. **Regular security audits**

## ðŸ”’ **Remember: Security is Everyone's Responsibility**
